<h2>The Hakluyt Society.<br />
<span class="smaller">REPORT FOR 1892.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Travels of Pietro della Valle in India</span>,
edited by Mr. Edward Grey, in two volumes, have been
issued to members during the year. More recently, a
volume containing Mr. Markham’s translation of the
<span class="smcap">Journal of Columbus’ First Voyage</span>, together with
documents relating to the voyages of John Cabot and
Gaspar Corte-Real, has also been issued.</p>

<p>Mr. Theodore Bent’s <span class="smcap">Early Voyages to the Levant</span>,
comprising the Diary of Thomas Dallam, and extracts
from the Diaries of Dr. John Covel, is now ready for issue;
and there will shortly appear, in two volumes, a collection
of <span class="smcap">Early Voyages to Hudson’s Bay in Search of
a North-West Passage</span>, edited by Mr. Miller Christy.
These contain carefully annotated transcripts of the rare
first editions of the North-West Foxe and Capt. James’s
Voyage.</p>

<p>The President has translated the <span class="smcap">Letters of Amerigo
Vespucci</span>, and other documents relating to the career of
the Florentine navigator, with Notes and an Introduction.
The volume is now ready for the press.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Brown’s <span class="smcap">Leo Africanus</span> is also ready for
press.</p>

<p>Among other works undertaken for our Society, Mr.
Miller Christy has in hand <span class="smcap">Jens Munk’s Voyage to
Hudson’s Bay</span>, translated from the Danish. This work
will complete our series of voyages to the North-West in
the first half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The Council having decided on sending a set of its
publications, as complete as possible, to the Chicago
Exhibition, the books (80) were suitably bound and sent
to Chicago. They were placed in the British Section
(Liberal Arts, Group clv), in a case specially made to hold
them. This set has since been purchased by an American
book collector at the price fixed, 310 dollars.</p>

<p>Our list of Subscribers, with a total of 289, shows an
increase on previous years. The balance at the bank was
£239 18<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> at the end of 1892.</p>

<p>The following Members of Council retire: Mr. Bouverie
Pusey, Mr. Ernest Satow, and Capt. Sir J. Sydney Webb;
and the following gentlemen are proposed for election:
Capt. Nathan, R.E., Mr. F. Ducane Godman, F.R.S., and
Mr. C. P. Lucas.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The two manuscript diaries which
are published in this volume
give us the experiences of men
who resided in Constantinople
during the earlier days of the
Levant Company. When Master
Thomas Dallam went with the present of a marvellous
organ from Queen Elizabeth to the Sultan
Mahomed III in 1599, our Company of Turkey
Merchants had scarcely organised themselves.
When Dr. Covel went as chaplain to the embassy
in 1670, the Company was still struggling to gain
for itself those rights—or capitulations, as they are
called—which formed the basis of the prosperity of
the Company during the ensuing century and a
half. Consequently, I think, a succinct account of
the rise of this Company will form a suitable introduction
to the perusal of the diaries themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span></p>

<p>In the development of our system of commerce
the Company of Turkey Merchants played a most important
part, second perhaps only to the great East
India Company, and its history is the history of one
of those pillars on which British prosperity has been
constructed. It was a marked feature of the sixteenth
century, when all those Companies—the African
Company, the Muscovy Company, the East India
Company—all had their rise, and by them was laid
the foundation of our subsequent mercantile successes.
The Levant Company lived an active life of 244
years; and, besides the amount of wealth it accumulated
for this country, it did infinite service in the
development of art and research, geography and
travel, the suppression of slavery, and the spread
of civilisation in countries which would still have
been unapproachable had not the continued efforts of
the 244 years been towards civilisation and humanity.</p>

<p>The history of the capitulations or treaties with
which foreign nations sought to establish themselves
in the greatest centre of commercial enterprise
before the opening out of other routes to
India is a very interesting one, and dates back to
remote ages, when commercial bodies were formed
in the city of Constantine, at the time when the
power of the Greek emperors was on the wane. As
far back as the ninth and tenth centuries of our era,
the emperors of the East granted to the Warings or
Varangians from Scandinavia capitulations or rights
of exterritoriality, which gave them permission to
own wharves, carry on trade, and govern themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
in the Eastern capital: these rights established
numerous <i>imperia in imperio</i> during the
succeeding centuries in Constantinople. The Venetians
obtained them early in the eleventh century;
the Amalfians in 1056, the Genoese in 1098, and
the Pisans in 1110, and henceforward they became
so general, that the Greeks of the later empire
complained that there were no wharves for themselves,
and that they could not compete with these
indefatigable foreign traders; much as we hear complaints
now amongst our own artisans of the influx
of German and Belgian workmen into England.</p>

<p>When the Turks took Constantinople they did
little to interfere with the existing order of things:
the Genoese and Venetians got their capitulations
renewed; the right to have disputes with their
fellow-countrymen decided by their own authorities;
the right to have questions between them and Ottoman
subjects decided only in presence of a Venetian
interpreter; exemption from the tax imposed
on Christians in lieu of military service; and the
right to appoint their own magistrates in Constantinople.
Being a nomadic race, the Ottoman Turks
cared little for commerce: their ships were the
caïques of the Greeks; their emperors wrote their
decrees in red ink, as their Greek predecessors had
done; and to the foreign traders who flocked to
Constantinople they gave the same privileges that
the Greek emperors had done, and, as far as they
were concerned, the <i>status quo</i> was maintained.</p>

<p>Meanwhile trade was passing westwards; the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
was come when the Portuguese, the French, and
finally the English were to succeed the Italian republics
as the commercial nations of the world.</p>

<p>In 1536 Sieur Foret arranged a capitulation for
the French between Sultan Solyman I and Francis I,
and the essential articles of this treaty have been
often redrawn and embodied in many treaties with
the different European Powers, and still remain as
the foundation of the many treaties under which
foreigners now live in Constantinople: matters of
dispute between Frenchmen were to be decided
only by their own authorities; questions between
Frenchmen and Turks were to be decided only in
the presence of the French dragoman; they could
appoint their own magistrates, and were exempt
from the <i>harach</i>. This was the first of what we
may call the modern capitulations, by which the
Western nations have obtained their footing in Constantinople;
they are by no means an invention of
the Turks, but a distinct inheritance from the old
Byzantine days, which they were compelled to adopt,
and which has turned out to be as great a boon to
the Mussulman as to the foreigner who obtained it.</p>

<p>In proportion to the exigencies of the Turk and
his want of money, the system of capitulations has
increased in strength. Encroachments have occurred;
fresh clauses have had to be introduced to meet the
subtleties of the Turk; the so-called <i>avanias</i>, of
which we shall hear more in Dr. Covel’s diary, had
to be combated; but, nevertheless, the progress has
been continuous, and no Company has contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
more to the success of the foreigner on Turkish soil
than the “Turkey Merchants” of England.</p>

<p>During the reign of Elizabeth, our infantile commercial
adventures were beginning to make themselves
felt. Early in the sixteenth century there
had been a few isolated cases of voyages to the
Levant in search of wealth. From 1511 to 1534
we hear of certain “tall ships belonging to London,
Southampton, and Bristol, which made voyages to
the East, trading with Sicily, Crete, Chios, and
sometimes Cyprus, Tripoli, and Beyrout in Syria”;
but there appears to have been no systematic commerce
carried on in English bottoms in those days,
most of the trade between the Levant and England
being conducted by the Venetians. So far back as
1513 we had a consul established at Chios, and in
1534 (Hakluyt, vol. ii, p. 98) we read of an exciting
voyage made by <i>The Holy Cross</i> and <i>The Matthew
Gonson</i> to Crete and Chios, both ships coming back
much the worse for wear. In 1550 Captain Bodenham,
with “the great Barke <i>Aucher</i>”, went to Chios,
and three years later Anthony Jenkinson went to
Aleppo, and got trading privileges “on a footing with
the most favoured nations”. This was the actual
foundation of our future capitulations, and the first
commencement of our Levant Company.</p>

<p>Up to this time the carrying trade between England
and the Levant had been carried on, on ships
called argosies, by the Venetians. Sir Paul Ricaut,
son of a London merchant, who was born in 1620,
was secretary to Lord Winchilsea, and consul at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Smyrna for eleven years; he wrote, by the direction
of Charles II, a work entitled <i>The Present State
of the Greek and Armenian Churches</i>. He also
wrote a book entitled <i>The Present State of the
Turkish Empire</i>, a very interesting work, the first
edition of which, Pepys tells us, was destroyed in the
Great Fire of London. In this work he tells us
that the ships known as argosies were so called
because they were built at Ragusa for the Venetian
merchants. “These vast carracks called argosies,
which are so famed for the vastness of their burthen
and bulk, were corruptly so denominated from
Ragosies, ships of Ragusa.” The Ragusans, as
merchants, were much to the fore in those days,
prior to the great earthquake, and had, as we see
from Dr. Covel’s diary, an ambassador of their own
at Constantinople.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</div>
<div class="verse">There, where your argosies, with portly sail,—</div>
<div class="verse">Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</div>
<div class="verse">Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,—</div>
<div class="verse">Do over-peer the petty traffickers,</div>
<div class="verse">That curt’sy to them, do them reverence,</div>
<div class="verse">As they fly by them with their woven wings.”</div>
<div class="attr">(Shakes., <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, Act i, Scene 1.)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of these argosies was wrecked off the Isle of
Wight about 1575, and it is said that the Venetians
refused to bring merchandise into such dangerous
seas after this catastrophe. Perhaps this argosy
may be the very one which suggested to Shakespeare
the shipwreck of the Venetian merchantman.
At any rate, this fact obliged individual action on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
the part of the English merchants of the day, and at
once necessitated the formation of a distinct Company,
if the trade with the Levant was to be continued.</p>

<p>Another point also contributed to the starting of
an independent trade with the Levant, namely, a
quarrel with Venice concerning the duties on currants
(<i>State Papers, Domestic</i>, 11th April, 1606).
In 1575 Venice had granted a patent to one Acerbo
Velutelli, a native of Lucca, which gave him the
sole right of importing to England currants and
oil from Venetian dominions. Velutelli contrived to
get these articles conveyed to England on English
ships, and, by exacting an export duty for his own
benefit, enriched himself and impoverished the Venetian
traders. Venice then imposed a fine of 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
on currants and oil conveyed to England in other
than Venetian bottoms. Elizabeth retaliated by a
similar fine on their importation, and for a time
trade in these commodities was at a standstill.</p>

<p>Yet another, and that a political, cause promoted
our intercourse with Turkey. Queen Elizabeth was
just entering into her vital contest with Philip II of
Spain, and to secure the alliance and co-operation of
the Sultan was one of her favourite schemes at this
critical juncture. Until the reign of Amurath III
the English had been altogether strangers to Turkey;
but in 1579 three merchants were sent to
Constantinople—William Harebone, Edward Ellis,
and Richard Staple—to spy out the land, as it were,
and, if possible, obtain for English merchants the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
same social and commercial privileges that other
nations enjoyed. Two years later Queen Elizabeth
formed a treaty charter with Amurath III for five
years, in which he styles himself “the most sacred
Mussulman-like Emperor”, and she also granted letters
patent to a small Company entitled “The Company
of Merchants of the Levant”, consisting of Sir E.
Osborne, Thomas Smith, Stephen and William
Garret—“because they had found out and opened a
trade in Turkey, not known in the memory of any
man now living to be frequented by our progenitors.”</p>

<p>The first of the Company’s ships to trade with
the Levant was sent out in 1582. It was called
<i>The Great Susan</i>, and William Harebone, the first
ambassador from England to the Ottoman Porte,
was carried out by her. He established factories
at Constantinople, obtained capitulations from the
Porte, and regularly inaugurated our trade there.
Harebone was considerably assisted by the great
Vizier Sokolli and the Sultan’s tutor, the learned
historian Seadedin, in his negotiations. (Von Hammer.)</p>

<p>At the same time it is evident that commercial
objects were not paramount in Queen Elizabeth’s
mind, but a desire to obtain the Sultan as an ally
against her formidable enemy. In her letters to the
Sultan she takes advantage of the well-known horror
the Mahommedans have of image-worship, and
styles herself, “the unconquered and most puissant
defender of the true faith against the idolaters who
falsely profess the name of Christ”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1587 her agent in Constantinople presented a
petition to Sultan Amurath III, for assistance against
the Spanish Armada, imploring him to send help
“against that idolater, the King of Spain, who, relying
on the help of the Pope and all idolatrous
princes, designs to crush the Queen of England, and
then to turn his whole power to the destruction of
the Sultan, and make himself universal monarch.”</p>

<p>Christendom, luckily for the reputation of Elizabeth,
never saw an alliance between the Crescent
and the Cross of so peculiar a nature brought to
any ultimate result. The Sultan promised, but did
nothing. Turkey was already on the decline,
and her internal troubles occupied her sufficiently.
Ranke, vol. i, p. 433, speaks of “the advances made
by the English Government to the Turks in the
time of Elizabeth”, and this factor had no doubt as
much to do with the formation of the Levant Company
as anything else.</p>

<p>In 1586 a charter was granted to fifty-three
individuals, with power to trade in the Levant; and
though, of course, the ambassador resided at Constantinople,
in those days the principal mart of
English trade was Aleppo, where Michael Locke
was at that time consul, whose account of the condition
of affairs in that city is quaint and interesting.
He also speaks of the trade of Chios being great some
years before, and alludes to it as “the great store of
sundry commodities”, and further states that in 1593
tin was the principal article of export from England.
He founded a factory at Aleppo which was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
of the most flourishing in the Levant for 150 years.
The outlet of this commerce was Scanderoon, and
we find all the vessels which traded to the East,
including the ship <i>Hector</i>, which took Master Dallam
out, going to Scanderoon before Constantinople.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Barton was the first resident ambassador
at Constantinople. Harebone had evidently
been only sent out as a plenipotentiary extraordinary
to inaugurate the intercourse with the Levant.
Hakluyt (vol. ii) gives us an account of the present
which Sir Edward Barton took out on the ship
<i>Ascension</i> in 1593 for the Sultan Amurath III: “12
goodly pieces of plate, 36 garments of cloth of all
colours, 20 garments of cloth of gold, 10 garments
of satin, 6 pieces of fine Holland, and certain other
things of good value.” To his powerful wife, the
Sultana Safiye, Queen Elizabeth sent a “jewel of
her Majesty’s picture set with rubies and diamonds;
3 pieces of gilt plate; 10 garments of cloth of gold;
a very fine case of glasse bottles, silver and gilt;
and 2 pieces of fine Holland.” With Mahomed III,
who succeeded his father, Amurath III, in 1595, Sir
E. Barton seems to have been on most intimate
terms, carrying on the traditional alliance, and hopes
of possible hope of support which had been started
in his father’s reign.</p>

<p>Mahomed III was the eldest son of Amurath,
one of his 103 children. He was a son of his
Venetian wife and favourite, the Sultana Safiye, a
lady of the House of Baffo, who had been captured
by a Turkish corsair in her youth. Mahomed III<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
put nineteen of his brothers to death on his accession,
the grossest instance of fratricide even in Turkish
annals. He was at the outset of his reign chiefly
engaged in wars in Hungary, and in these Sir
Edward Barton accompanied him. They ended in
the victory of Cerestes, and, on his return to Constantinople,
Sir E. Barton, worn out by the rigours
of the campaign, died. In Sultan Mahomed III’s
letter to Queen Elizabeth, in 1596, he thus alludes
to Sir E. Barton: “As to your highnesse’s well-beloved
Ambassador at our blessed Porte, Edward
Barton, one of the nation of the Messiah, he having
been enjoined by us to follow our imperial camp
without having been enabled previously to obtain
your highness’s permission to go with my imperial
Staff, we have reason to be satisfied, and to hope
that also your highness will know how to appreciate
the services he has thus rendered to us in our
imperial camp.”</p>

<p>Mustapha, the first Turkish envoy to England in
1607, also alludes to Sir E. Barton: “Mr. Barton
was in the army ... when Raab, <i>alias</i> Severin,
was won from the Christians.”</p>

<p>Sir E. Barton came of a Yorkshire family, and
was sent out to Constantinople as ambassador in
1593, with the title of “Agent for her Majesty with
the Grand Seignior”. Subsequently, however, he
received his stipend from the Levant Company.
He died at Chalki, one of the Prince’s Islands, in
1597, and was buried at the monastery there. His
tombstone (which Dr. Covel saw, <a href="#Page_281"><i>vide</i> p. 281</a>) was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
displaced and put over the door of the monastery
wrong way up, until Lord Strangford had it put in
its present position, and the following inscription is
still legible:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Eduardo Barton, Illustrissimo Serenissimo Anglorum Reginæ
Oratori viro præstantissimo, qui post reditum a bello Ungarico
quo cum invicto Turcorum imperatore, profectus fuerat diem
obiit, pietatis ergo, ætatis anno xxxv. Sal. vero <span class="smcapuc">MDXCVII XVIII</span>
Kal. Januar.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Henry Lello was appointed to succeed Sir E.
Barton. From the Venetian Baily’s report we learn
about his reception by the Sultan. He calls him
Sir Henry Billoe (Von Hammer), but this is an
obvious mistake. Sir Henry Lello wrote regularly
to England an account of affairs as they progressed
at Constantinople. His term of office is chiefly
marked by a prolonged quarrel with the French
ambassador, to which Dallam refers in his MS.
(<a href="#Page_81"><i>vide</i> p. 81</a>), to settle which the Baily of Venice, one
of the Capello family, was chosen arbiter.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Lello’s correspondence is now in the
Record Office, and from one of his letters we learn
officially how the Sultan received the present which
Dallam took out. I herewith transcribe a considerable
portion of it as bearing very good testimony to
the accuracy of Master Thomas Dallam’s MS.:—</p>

<h3>§ 2.—<span class="smcap">Of the Dallam Family.</span></h3>

<p>Such was the state of affairs in Constantinople
when Master Thomas Dallam, whose diary we here
produce, went to present a complicated organ, which
he had made, as a gift from Queen Elizabeth to
Sultan Mahomed III. His MS. diary was written
just after the publication of Richard Hakluyt’s
volumes of travels, or else it would in all probability
have been included in them. From the foregoing
remarks it will easily be seen why so handsome a
gift was sent out with so much trouble; the Queen
was anxious for the Sultan’s friendship and allegiance
against her Catholic enemies. To further the
interests of the infantile Levant Company such a
present would be exceedingly useful, and, in choosing
Dallam as the bearer of this present, Queen Elizabeth
evidently selected, as subsequent events showed,
the most skilled man in his craft that she could.</p>

<p>Some interesting notes with regard to this present
may be gathered from the State Papers, Jan. 1596.
For some time there had been a discussion about
sending a present to the new Sultan of Turkey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
The Levant merchants apparently thought it would
imperil their own safety and their factories in
Constantinople if Sir E. Barton’s papers were not
made out by the Queen, and if the present did not
come from her Majesty herself. Hence, out of compliance
with their wishes, Sir E. Barton, though
the Company’s nominee, was accredited as ambassador
from Queen Elizabeth, and the present, which
the Levant merchants no doubt paid for, purported
to be from the Queen of England to the Sultan.</p>

<p>In the State Papers, January 31st, 1599, just a
month before Dallam set out on his voyage, the
following entry is made: “A great and curious
present is going to the Grand Turk, which will
scandalise other nations, especially the Germans.”
This great and curious present was the organ which
Dallam had built, and which he was about to take
out in person.</p>

<p>Of the previous history of Thomas Dallam we
know little. From the tombstone of his son in New
College, Oxford, we gather that he came from the
village of Dallam, in Lancashire, not far from
Warrington. From the papers of the Blacksmiths’
Company we learn that he came up to London, and
was apprenticed to that Company, and admitted
as a liveryman of the same. In those days the
Blacksmiths’ Company had supervision over many
Companies, including the organ-builders, and in this
branch of the craft Thomas Dallam was employed.</p>

<p>From Dr. Rimbault we learn many details concerning
this celebrated family of organ-builders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
the instruments they constructed. Of this particular
one, which Dallam made, and which was set up
in Whitehall for Queen Elizabeth’s approval prior
to its being shipped off to Constantinople, there
appears to be no other record; but, immediately on
his return from the East, Thomas Dallam seems to
have worked hard at his trade, and he and his sons
constructed most of the principal organs of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In 1605-6 Dallam was engaged for fifty-eight
weeks in constructing the organ of King’s College,
Cambridge, for which purpose he closed his workshop
in London, and for this work he received the
sum of £371 17<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> This organ was destroyed
in the civil wars, but the case still remains. In 1607
he got £1 15<i>s.</i> for tuning the same organ, and a like
sum for the sale of surplus tin, and his name frequently
occurs in the College records till 1641. In
1613 Dallam made “new double organs” for Worcester
Cathedral, and got £211. This organ was
likewise destroyed in the rebellion.</p>

<p>On 29th of September 1626, Thomas Dallam was
made a steward of the annual feast of the Blacksmiths’
Company, but did not put in an appearance,
and was fined £10 for neglect of duty. In the
following year he petitioned in court to be let off his
stewardship, and his petition was granted him on
payment of certain small fines.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after his return from Constantinople
Thomas Dallam must have married, for
his eldest son, Robert, was born in 1602, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
brought up by his father in the organ-building trade
under the auspices of the Blacksmiths’ Company.
Together, between 1624 and 1627, they put up an
organ in Durham Cathedral, which was eventually
sold to the Church of St. Michael-le-Belfry, York,
where it remained till 1885, and was finally disposed
of to Mr. Bell, organ-builder, York, for the sum of
four pounds.</p>

<p>Robert Dallam also built an organ for Jesus College,
Cambridge, for £200, and several others.
Finally, we hear of him as engaged to build an organ
for New College, Oxford; and he died at Oxford,
May 31st, 1665, and, from his tomb in that College
we learn certain particulars about the family, the
concluding lines of which would seem rather to refer
to his father than himself, for we have no record of
his having travelled in distant lands. It runs as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hic jacet Dᵐⁿᵘˢ Robertas Dallam Instrumenti Pneumatici
(quod vulgo organum nuncupant) peritissimus artifex filius
Thomæ Dallum de Dallum in comitat: Lancastriæ mortuus est
die Maii ultimo</p>

<p>“anno Domini 1665 ætatis suæ 63.</p>

<p>“Qui postquam diversas Europæ plagas hâc arte (quâ præcipue
claruit) exornasset solum hoc tandem, in quo requiescit cinere
suo insignivit.”</p>

</div>

<p>Ralph Dallam, another son of Thomas, also an
organ-builder, constructed the organ which was put
up in St. George’s Chapel after the Restoration, and
also built organs in Rugby, Hackney, and Lynn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
Regis, and died whilst making the organ in Greenwich
Chapel in 1672.</p>

<p>George Dallam, another son, lived in Purple Lane
in 1672, and in 1686 added a “chaire organ” to
Harris’s instrument in Hereford Cathedral.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that Thomas Dallam, the
writer of the diary, was the progenitor of a distinguished
family of organ-builders, whose work was
in great request in the seventeenth century. We
have also to thank him for the graphic account of
the Imperial Court at Constantinople during the reign
of Mahomed III, and incidents in seafaring life at
that period, which add considerably to our knowledge
of the state of nautical affairs as they existed
in the days of Raleigh and Drake.</p>

<h3>§ 3.—<span class="smcap">Of the further Progress of the Levant
Company.</span></h3>

<p>It was understood from the first that the Levant
Company should pay and appoint the consuls, ambassadors,
and other officials of their Company, though
difficulties arose on this point between the Government
and the Company concerning the salary of Sir
Edward Barton. Affairs seem to have gone on
smoothly till 1600, when the monopoly was removed,
and the Company had to struggle on as best it
could against competition which proved almost fatal
to it at the very outset of its career.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in 1605, we find petitions from the
Company to James I, complaining that they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
no longer pay the salaries of the ambassadors and
consuls, and that they feared that the Turks might
seize their factories and buildings in the Turkish
towns. Lord Salisbury entered into consultation
with Chief Justice Popham on the subject, and the
result was that, on the 14th December 1606, letters
patent were granted by James I which may really be
said to have established the Company on a permanent
basis. The five years’ terminable licences were
made perpetual, and privileges were granted to
several persons and their sons, and such others as
should be after admitted. The Company was to
have the monopoly of all the Levant trade: in fact,
the English traffic of nearly all the Mediterranean
was handed over exclusively to the Company, which
was to be open to all merchants who could pay £50
towards the expenses of carrying on the trade, the
salary of the ambassadors and consuls, and the
presents which, from time to time, were necessary to
be given to the Sultan to keep him favourably disposed,
and the first year’s “imposition”, or tax of
£5,322, was handed over to the Company to assist
in tiding over a time of difficulty.</p>

<p>Thomas Glover, who had been one of Thomas
Dallam’s companions on board the ship <i>Hector</i> on
his journey out, was ambassador at this time, with
power to appoint consuls and regulate the trade for
the Company. It does not appear what emolument
he got from the Company, but it was doubtless considerable,
as he was forbidden to trade on his own
account, and, under his skilful management, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
successful career of the Levant Company was inaugurated.</p>

<p>It was absolutely necessary in those early days of
mercantile enterprise to give the monopoly of the
Levant trade to one Company; only a rich and
united body, with the privileges accorded to them
by their capitulations, could carry on such trade. It
was necessary, for the safety of the ships, that they
should sail in large numbers for mutual protection
from Dunkirkers, corsairs, and other hostile craft,
and hence very strict penalties were imposed on
private individuals who sought to carry on trade
under the protection of the Company without actually
belonging to it. The celebrated case of Bates, who
refused to pay a tax to the Company on currants,
and drove them off in his own cart from the wharf,
was tried shortly after this, and when it was decided
in the Company’s favour, their monopoly was clearly
established.</p>

<p>In the reign of James I the Company received
the name of “The Governor and Company of Merchants
of England trading to the Levant Seas”, and
the arms of a ship with three masts in full sail between
two rocks. Their crest was a demi sea-horse
salient; their supporters two sea-horses; and their
motto, “Deo Respublicæ et amicis.”</p>

<p>In 1612, Mr. Paul Pindar, another of Thomas
Dallam’s companions on board the ship <i>Hector</i>,
succeeded Sir Thomas Glover as ambassador for the
Company to the Porte.</p>

<p>In 1623, Sir T. Roe was ambassador. He got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
salary of £1,800 per ann. from the Company, besides
a portion of the consulage and other advantages, but
at the same time he was forbidden to carry on a
trade of any kind. During this period the Levant
Company continued to make satisfactory progress,
and the only thing to remark is the controversies
which, during the reigns of James I and Charles I,
raged between the regulated Companies, namely, the
Levant Company and Merchant Adventurers, against
the East India Company, which, as then constituted,
they considered as the monopoly of a few which told
against the monopoly of larger corporate bodies.</p>

<p>In 1643 further privileges were granted to the
Levant Company. In an ordinance of both Houses,
upholding the Levant Merchants, dated 9th of
March 1643, the following points occur:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That for the better supportation and encouragement of the
Fellowship of merchants of England, trading to the Levant Seas,
which, besides the building and maintaining of divers great ships,
both for defence and burthen, the venting of kerseys, sages,
perpetuanas, and several other commodities hath been found
very serviceable and profitable to the State, by advancing navigation,
and transporting into foreigne parts for severall years together
above 20,000 broadclothes per annum, besides other
commodities whereby the poor people are sett at worke, and the
whole kingdome receive benefit. The Lords and Commons do
ordaine:—</p>

<p>“That the Fellowship of Merchants trading to the Levant
Seas shall continue a corporation; that they shall have free choice
and removal of all ministers by them maintained at home and
abroad, whether they be dignified and called by the name of Ambassadors,
Governours, Deputies, Consulls, or otherwise.</p>

<p>“That they shall have power to levie monies on the members
of their corporation, or on strangers; on goods shipped in English
bottoms, or on English goods in strange bottoms, which shall goe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
into or come from the Levant Seas, for and towards necessary
charge, maintenance, and supply of their ministers, officers, and
government.</p>

<p>“That no person shall send ships into these parts limited by
their corporation, but such as are free brothers, or otherwise
licensed, each person to pay, if a mere merchant, £50, if above
twenty-one years of age, or £25 if under that age; and they
shall have power to fine persons disobeying their orders in a sum
not exceeding £20, or imprisoning their persons till the said sum
be paid.”</p>

</div>

<p>About this time the Levant Company suffered
somewhat from the conflicting state of parties in
England. Sir S. Crowe was appointed in 1642 as
ambassador of the Levant Company; he was a
staunch loyalist, and, during his tenure of office
abroad, his goods in England were confiscated by
the Parliamentarians. On hearing this, Sir S. Crowe
imprisoned many of the English factors in Constantinople,
and appropriated their goods. The Parliamentarians
forthwith obliged the Company to send
out another representative, Sir J. Bendish, who,
after some difficulty, succeeded in establishing himself
as the ambassador of England, and Sir S. Crowe
was sent home. On arriving in London, he was
impeached at the suit of the Company, condemned,
and kept in prison till 1653.</p>

<p>The regulations of the Company with regard to
their <i>employés</i> were very strict in those days; none
of the consuls under their authority might marry
without the consent of the directors, and the factors
or merchants at Constantinople and elsewhere in the
Levant frequently received admonitions from the
governing body at home against “sensuality, gambling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
Sabbath-breaking, neglect of public worship”, and
other irregularities of life in which the merchants,
far from the influence of their strait-laced relatives
at home, were prone to indulge.</p>

<p>In 1661 the Earl of Winchilsea went out on <i>The
Plymouth</i> as ambassador for the Company. Captain
Hayward was in command of the vessel, with
whom Pepys (p. 50) made merry at the Rhenish
Wine House. Lord Winchilsea is described as “a
jovial Lord, extremely favoured by Vizier Kiuprili”.
Two Kiuprilis, father and son, were practically the
rulers of Turkey from 1658 to the death of the
latter in 1676. Both the Kiuprilis were men of
exceedingly good powers of organisation, and raised
Turkey to comparative power, despite the weakness
of her princes. The Sultan Mahomed IV, about
whom Dr. Covel in his MS. tells us so much, was
a man of weak character, devoted only to the chase,
and left the organisation of the empire to his Vizier.
From him Lord Winchilsea obtained further capitulations,
an account of which is given us by his
secretary, Paul Ricaut, in a pamphlet entitled <i>The
Capitulations and Articles published by Paul Ricaut,
Esquire, Secretary to his Excellencie the Lord Ambassador,
in 1663</i>, and addressed to the Governors
of the Levant Company. In this pamphlet he says:
“The first capitulations took place 80 years before,
in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, and have been enlarged
in the time of allmost every ambassador, with such
alterations as the state of affaires, and the abuses,
and the iniquities of the times suggested.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
principal grievance which this set of capitulations
rectified was “that English ships should be exempt
from search for foreign goods”. Mahomed IV, in
his address to Charles II, on the occasion of the
granting of these capitulations, speaks in high-flown
language of “the Queen of the aforesaid Kingdom”
who commenced the Levant trade.</p>

<p>A curious and ludicrous instance of the fanaticism
of the times occurred in 1661. An individual
called “John the Quaker” arrived at Constantinople,
and began to preach at the street corners
repentance to the Turks in his own native tongue.
Naturally enough, the Mohammedans looked upon
him as a lunatic, and consigned him to a mad-house,
where he languished for eight months, until his
nationality was discovered, and he was taken before
Lord Winchilsea. On entering the ambassador’s
presence, true to the regulations of his creed, John
refused to remove his hat, whereupon he was bastinadoed;
and, on his clothes being examined, a letter
was discovered in his pocket addressed to the Sultan,
politely telling that monarch that he was the scourge
employed by God to punish wicked Christians.</p>

<p>There was a distinct revival at this juncture in
the condition of the power of the Ottoman Turks at
Constantinople; under the severe rule of the elder
Kiuprili, and the firm but temperate jurisdiction of
his son Ahmed, both internal and external affairs
prospered favourably. Ahmed Kiuprili conducted
the wars with Austria with a fair amount of success.
He won Crete for the Turks, in 1669, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Venetian general Morosini; the wars with Sobieski,
under his guidance, were, with certain fluctuations,
favourable to the Turks. He, in 1675, instituted
the levy of 3,000 boys from the Christian population
to fill the ranks of the Janissaries; and three
days after the peace of Zuranna, by which the Turks
regained much of their lost military prestige, he
died, very shortly after the events related in such
minute detail by Dr. Covel in our second manuscript,
and very shortly after the ratification of further
capitulations with the Levant Company at Adrianople;
the incidents concerning the obtaining of which
Dr. Covel relates so graphically.</p>

<h3>§ 4.—<span class="smcap">Of Dr. John Covel.</span></h3>

<p>The writer of the second MS. we have before us
is mentioned by Evelyn in his <i>Diary</i> (ii, 338) as
“Covel, the great Oriental traveller”. Evidently
he intended either to publish a work himself, or that
his diary should be published shortly after his death,
for he divided part of his MS. into chapters, put in
illustrations, and collected together everything connected
with himself, every scrap of letter and paper
that would be of use, even down to his <i>testamur</i>
when he took his B.A. in 1657; but this mass of
MS. has remained hidden in the British Museum,
and has never yet seen the light of day. It is easy
to see why any publisher would recoil from bringing
out so prolix a work, for the Doctor is wearisome
in the extreme. Before we leave Deal, in his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
chapter, at the outset of his travels, we are treated
to at least thirty closely-written pages on the
wonders of the deep, which he picked up there;
soon follows a long dissertation on sea-sickness, and
its supposed causes; and whenever he came near
any place of archæological interest, such as Carthage,
Ephesus, Constantinople, etc., he gives us enough
information to fill a good-sized volume on each
spot. Consequently, it has been found necessary to
eliminate much in Dr. Covel’s exceedingly bulky
diaries.</p>

<p>His narrative is, however, extremely interesting
on many points: during the six-and-a-half years he
resided at Constantinople, from 1670 to 1677, he
noticed everything; his sketches of life, costumes,
and manners are minute and life-like. Sir George
Wheeler says, in his volume of travels: “Dr. Covel,
then chaplain to his Majesty’s ambassador there,
amongst many curiosities shewed us some Turkish
songs set to musick; which he told us were, both
for sense and music, very good: but past our understanding.”
Being, as he was, intimately connected
with the embassy, he had ample opportunity for
studying the politics of the time. Dr. Covel was
present at the granting of the capitulations of 1676,
which gained for the Levant Company privileges
which established it, for the ensuing century and
a half of its existence, on an unapproachable
foundation.</p>

<p>John Covel was born at Horningsheath, in Suffolk,
in 1638, and educated at Bury St. Edmunds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
Christs College, Cambridge, in the hall of which
his portrait, by Valentine Ritz, is still to be seen.
He studied medicine in early life with a view to
being a physician, which will account for his intimate
knowledge of botany and drugs; but eventually,
being elected to a Fellowship at his College,
he changed his line in life and took Holy
Orders.</p>

<p>Covel was distinguished for his erudition, and
was a scholar of no mean repute, as his MS. shows;
and on the Restoration, in 1661, he was deputed to
make a Latin oration in the hall of Christ’s College,
to celebrate the return of the Stuart family to the
throne of England. He composed a long poem
also to celebrate this event, a few stanzas of which
I give here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The Horrible winter’s gone,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And we enjoy a cheerful spring;</div>
<div class="verse">The kind approach of the Sun</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Gives a new birth to every thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The trees with blossoms are crowned now,</div>
<div class="verse">Which then did penance in snow;</div>
<div class="verse">And there with busy noise the Bee</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Just so, great Prince, when you arrived,</div>

<div class="verse">Gave us new life and sense.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Too rigid Fate</div>

<div class="verse">And, with a boisterous storm,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh, may your glories ever shine!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Always rising still more bright.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">What never stops at any height</div>
<div class="verse">Can never decline.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1669 Covel was appointed as chaplain to the
ambassador at Constantinople, Sir Daniel Harvey,
by the Levant Company, and Charles II gave him
a dispensation to go to Constantinople and hold his
Fellowship at the same time: it runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Given at our Court at Dover, 19th day of May, in the 22nd
year of our reign. Our will and pleasure is that you dispense
with the absence of the said John Covel, so that he receive and
enjoy (by Himself or his assignees) all and singular the profits,
dividends, stipends, emoluments, and dues belonging to his fellowship
in as full and ample manner to all intents and purposes as
if he were actually resident in the College.”</p>

</div>

<p>During his residence at Constantinople he witnessed
many important sights, notably the great
<i>fêtes</i> at Adrianople in honour of the circumcision of
Prince Mustapha, and the marriage of the Sultan’s
daughter, which were the most noted <i>fêtes</i> of the
century in Turkey,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and also the granting of the
capitulations during the time of the plague. The
next nine years of Covel’s life were spent in travel.
In 1679 he returned to England, and immediately
afterwards took his D.D., and was chosen as
Margaret preacher of Divinity at Cambridge. In
1681 he got one of his college livings of Kegworth,
and was soon afterwards appointed as chaplain to
the Princess of Orange, and resided at the Hague.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
In October 1685 the Prince of Orange intercepted
a letter written by Dr. Covel to Skelton, the English
ambassador, giving an account of Prince William’s
tyrannical behaviour to his wife. Dr. Covel was
forthwith dispatched home again in great disgrace;
he never spoke of what had transpired, and it was
long a mystery. There is, however, a letter to
Princess Mary amongst his papers, in which he
speaks of the scurrilous reports which alleged that
he tried to make mischief between the King and the
Prince, and between the Prince and your Royal
Highness, and concludes, “in the words of the
Royal Martyr, your most glorious grandfather, that
as He hath given us afflictions to try our patience,
so He would give us Patience to bear our afflictions.”</p>

<p>Dr. Covel was twice Vice-Chancellor of the University
of Cambridge, the first time in 1689, when
King William visited the University, and his letters
show a considerable degree of anxiety as to how
the King, whom he had maligned as Prince, would
receive him. In reply to these anxieties, King
William sent a curt answer, stating “that he could
distinguish between Dr. Covel and the Vice-Chancellor
of the University”.</p>

<p>Dr. Covel, was not fortunate with his voluminous
writings; he got into another scrape with the Court in
a book entitled <i>The Interpreter of Words and Terms</i>;
it was ordered to be destroyed, being, as it was
supposed, “in some points very derogatory to the
supreme power of this Crown”. He also wrote on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
gardening and fruit-trees; but his <i>magnum opus</i> was
a work on the Greek Church, which he published
shortly before his death, which remained for long the
standard work on the subject. It is entitled: <i>Some
Account of the present Greek Church, with Reflections
on their present Doctrine and Discipline, particularly
on the Eucharist and the rest of their seven Pretended
Sacraments</i>. In his Preface he apologises for
the long delay, owing to his “itinerant life”, and
having been “chained to a perpetual college bursar’s
place”. It is evident from his diary that, when at
Constantinople, Dr. Covel gave himself up to this
study very closely, in fact, he was deputed to do so,
for the controversy was then at its height which
was started by M. Arnold, Doctor of the Sorbonne,
as to whether the Greeks held the doctrine of
transubstantiation or not, and a union between the
Eastern and Western Churches was much feared by
the Protestants. The eccentric Marquis de Nointel,
who was the French ambassador to the Porte at
that time, was most eager to bring this about, and
as he was on very friendly terms with Sir John
Finch, it was suspected that he used his influence
to win over the English ambassador; hence Dr.
Covel had an important task to perform, and no
wonder he writes so bitterly on the ignorance and
corruption of the Greek clergy. To show his zeal,
the Marquis de Nointel celebrated Midnight Mass
on Christmas Eve, 1673, in the cave of Antiparos,
with a broken-off stalactite as his communion-table,
on which may still be read the words he carved:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span></p>

<p>The ambassador was accompanied by five hundred
people—his domestics, merchants, Greeks, and Turks—and
he was so impressed by it, that he repeated
the experiment on two subsequent occasions. The
proposed union of the Churches, however, never
came to anything, and by the time Dr. Covel’s book
came out the controversy was at an end and forgotten.</p>

<p>Dr. Covel was appointed Master of Christ’s College
in 1688, and retained this position until his
death in 1722, at the ripe age of eighty-four.</p>

<p>The good work that Sir John Finch did for the
Company in getting the capitulation of 1676, as Dr.
Covel relates, in the teeth of the plague at Adrianople,
did much for the security of trading and property
in the Levant. Attached to these capitulations is
the following clause: “That two ships’ loads of figs
and currants should be allowed to be annually exported
from Smyrna for the use of the King’s
kitchen.” Sir John Finch was the son of the Speaker
of the House of Commons, and was brought up as
a physician, together with his bosom companion
Thomas Baines; they studied together in England,
and in Padua, and when Sir John was appointed as
Minister to Tuscany, he got Charles II to attach his
friend as physician to the legation, and also to bestow
on him the honour of knighthood. When Sir
John Finch was moved to Constantinople Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
Baines accompanied him in the same capacity; they
were together with Covel during the trying time of
the plague at Adrianople, and frequent allusion is
made to them both in the diary. They were known
in Constantinople as the ambassador and the chevalier,
the two inseparable friends, whose attachment
to one another was as romantic as that of Damon
and Pythias. Sir Thomas Baines died in Constantinople
in 1680, and, in great grief, his friend had his
body embalmed and sent home to be buried in
Christ’s College. Two years later, immediately on
his return to England, Sir John Finch himself died,
and, by special request, was buried in the same tomb
as his friend, with the same marble slab over them,
on which Henry More wrote a touching epitaph.
Jointly, they endowed two scholarships and two fellowships
for Christ’s College, and are still jointly
thanked as benefactors of that very College over
which their friend and companion in adversity, Dr.
Covel, ruled for forty years after their deaths.</p>

<h3>§ 5.—<span class="smcap">Of the subsequent History of the Levant Company.</span></h3>

<p>From the life of Dudley North, afterwards Sir
Dudley, son of Lord North, and ambassador for the
Company to the Porte, which life was written by his
son, we get an interesting insight into the life and
times of those Merchant Adventurers in the seventeenth
century, who were undoubtedly the founders
of our national fortunes and national pre-eminence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Dudley North was born in 1641, and went out to
Smyrna as supercargo, and was apprenticed to a
Turkey merchant when eighteen years of age, with
a capital of £400. For many years he lived a most
frugal life, making himself master of the Turkish
language, and keeping himself aloof from the extravagant
and luxurious lives which the English
merchants in the Smyrniote factories lived in those
days. When they “procured a pack of hounds,
and hunted in the country, after the English way”,
young North resisted the temptation to buy a horse,
and went out hunting on an ass. He was a young
man sure of eventual success. On his subsequent
removal to Constantinople, and employment in the
factory of Messrs. Hedges and Palmer, he lived in
the building itself, and looked after the bookkeeping,
and gained his first credit by getting in the outstanding
debts of the firm. He made himself master
of the “rules of Turkish justice”, and at once
set about to institute five hundred claims in the law
courts. These claims he conducted himself in the
Turkish Courts in the Turkish language, and won
a great many of those which his employers had
hitherto looked upon as hopeless.</p>

<p>He soon set up business on his own account, and
as it rapidly increased, he sent for his brother Montagu,
from Aleppo, and together the brothers built
up for themselves the fabric of a colossal fortune.</p>

<p>The brothers North appear to have dealt largely
in jewels, with which they tempted the women of
the Seraglio, and to have lent money at from 20<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
to 30 per cent. to impecunious Pashas. Dudley
North became treasurer of the Levant Company in
Constantinople, did excellent work in the survey of
the city, and eventually concluded his successful
career by being appointed ambassador for the Company
to the Porte. He was a man of strong business
capacity, and “his first care”, says his son, “on
setting up for himself, was to get a fire-tight room to
secure his goods from fire, and a sofa-room in which
to entertain the Turks.”</p>

<p>About this time we hear ever more and more,
in the Levant Company’s dealings with the Turks, of
the <i>avanias</i>, or unauthorised demands made by the
Turks on foreign merchants. Sir Dudley North at
once took up this question, and wrote himself an
interesting account of these encroachments on the
capitulations granted to the Turkey merchants.
The <i>avanias</i> had their origin in small matters of
etiquette; gradually they spread to commerce and
merchandise, and in 1685 came the great edict,
which obliged every foreigner who had married a
Turkish subject, himself to become a subject of the
Porte, and these men were forbidden to leave the
country without the Sultan’s consent.</p>

<p>This edict has given rise to the still numerous
Levantine families to be found in the Turkish Empire,
families bearing English, French, and Italian
names, and tracing their origin to those nations, but
practically absorbed in the Ottoman Empire. It
was a great blow to many artisans and merchants
who had married and settled in the Levant. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
less than forty French watchmakers, who had married
Greek wives and settled in Galata, were obliged
to become Turkish subjects in spite of the remonstrances
of the French ambassador, and the case of
Mr. Pentloe settled the question with regard to the
English. He had married a Greek lady, and on his
death left a will appointing two English merchants
as his executors, obliging them to realise his property,
and send his widow and her two children to England.
Accordingly, the executors proceeded to carry out
his wishes, but the Turkish Government seized Mrs.
Pentloe and her children on embarkation, and threw
the two executors into prison, from which they did
not emerge for some considerable period; all Mr.
Pentloe’s money was confiscated, and our ambassador
could get no redress. This iniquitous <i>avania</i> was
not repealed for a hundred years afterwards, and
may be taken as the origin of most of the so-called
Levantine families, great numbers of which are to
be found in Constantinople, Smyrna, Salonika, and
other trade centres in the Turkish Empire.</p>

<p>The progress of the Levant Company was steady,
and prosperity attended their commerce. Notwithstanding,
in 1681 we find the Turkey merchants
petitioning Parliament against the East India Company,
and begging for permission to have “exercise
of trade in the Red Sea, and all other dominions of
the Grand Signior, and to forbid the East India
Company to import raw or wrought silks”; and further
stating that as their freights were “raw silks, gaules,
grograms, yarn, cotton, etc., and as they, not being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
joint-stock Company, did not export much gold”, that
the East India Company ought to be restricted from
importing such things as they considered they only
had the monopoly of. To this petition the East
India Company drew up an exhaustive reply, and
Parliament set the petition on one side.</p>

<p>For the first three decades of the last century the
prosperity of the Levant Company may be said to
have been at its height. In the years 1716 and
1717 they exported to Turkey “43,000 cloths,
and a very great quantity of lead, tin, sugar, etc.”
In 1718, for the greater protection of merchants,
“general ships”, which sailed together in large
squadrons, were appointed, and the manufacturers
had nothing to do but to convey their goods to the
wharves, consign them to the shipowners, and pay
the freight. These general ships, as they were
called, used to leave England about July 1st, so as
to have good weather in the open seas, and reach
Turkey about the right time for the winter markets;
then they returned home with raw silks, mohair, and
other products of the East.</p>

<p>For some cause or another, in 1753 the condition
of the Levant Company was not so satisfactory. In
this year they sent a petition to Parliament for the
remodelling of their charter on more favourable conditions.
In this petition they stated that a quarrel
between Sir Kenelm Digby and the Venetian admiral
in the Bay of Scanderoon had cost the Company
£20,000; that the indiscretion of a young man at
Aleppo had imperilled the lives of all Europeans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
and incurred enormous losses on the Company; that
they had to pay an indemnity of £12,000 for
prisoners taken in war, and other similar misfortunes
had fallen upon them. Consequently, Parliament
thought fit to grant them their petition: they were
to have unmolested choice of the ministers maintained
by them at home and abroad, ambassadors,
governors, deputies, consuls, etc.; nobody except
free brothers of the corporation could send ships
into those parts, and very stringent rules were made
on this point, full powers being given to the Company
to fine, imprison, and send home in custody
any individuals who infringed this rule; they were
allowed to make their own laws and by-laws, though
these had to receive the sanction of the Board of
Trade; and, with various little assistances from
Government in minor points, the Company of Levant
Merchants again became exceedingly flourishing, and
continued to be so until the end of its days.</p>

<p>At the end of the last century it would appear
that the Company consisted of eight hundred members,
each and all calling themselves “Turkey Merchants”.
The wages of their officials, that is to say,
the ambassador, secretaries, chaplains, consuls, and
physicians at Constantinople, Smyrna, Aleppo, Alexandria,
Algiers, Patras, etc., came to £15,000 per
annum. Many of our consulates in the East, as
they now stand, were built by them, and the fine embassy
at Constantinople cost the Company £10,000.
The Porte gave the ground for this building out of
gratitude to England for driving the French out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
Egypt, and the opening of it was hallowed by the
liberation of many Christian slaves, mostly Maltese,
who came in a body to the ambassador to tender
their heartfelt thanks.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In 1803 it was that the British Government first
assumed the appointment and payment of the ambassador
and his secretaries; this was the first
step towards the disestablishment of the Company.
The Eastern Question was then beginning to make
itself felt, the Balkan States were in arms against
Turkey, and, the interests of trade being naturally
subordinate to foreign policy, the Levant Company
had to give way.</p>

<p>In 1825, when the disintegration of the Turkish
Empire appeared imminent, the Levant Company
came to an end. Mr. Canning’s communication to
them ran as follows: “It results solely from considerations
of public expediency, and in no degree
from any disrespect, or disposition to impute any
blame to their past administration.” The fact was
obvious: the new order of things had to supersede
the old; the political atmosphere was full of ideas of
free trade; and the aristocratic, exclusive Company
of Turkey Merchants had to give way, and they did
so gracefully. The deed of surrender was drawn
up in 1825, “of all the several grants, privileges,
liberties, powers, jurisdictions, and immunities granted
and conferred by their charters”; and in solemn conclave
the Company of merchants dissolved themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
after honourably providing pensions for their
officials, and handing over a substantial balance to
the treasury.</p>

<p>During its life of 244 years the Levant Company
had had a most exemplary and noble career, beneficial
not only to its members, but to the English
nation, building up for her her commerce, and making
her name respected in the East. It would take
a volume to enumerate the deeds of their great men,
and how they have not only contributed to our
commercial success, but have embellished our literature
with admirable studies both of the past and of
the present. Sir Paul Ricaut and Sir James Porter
wrote admirable works on the policy and government
of the Turkish people. Montague, Covel, and
Pococke gave some of the earliest accounts of the
people of the East in our tongue.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the Company, considerable
attention was paid to archæology: Spon and Wheeler,
Chishull, Shaw, and last, but not least, Lord Elgin,
who rescued the marbles of the Parthenon from
being damaged in the bombardment of 1827. The
Company’s doctors used to make a special study of
the plague. <i>Russell on the Plague</i> was quite the
standard work of its time, and Dr. Maclean also
made a special study of that dread disease; and to
the efforts of these men we may almost say that we
owe the gradual diminution and eventual eradication
of the malady.</p>

<p>The rescuing of slaves from corsairs, the liberation
of oppressed Christians, whether they happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
to be English, Greeks, or Armenians, will be for
ever one of the noblest and proudest of our actions.
Without the influence of the Levant Company,
Greece would probably have never succeeded in
establishing her independence, and the Mussulmans
would have effectually eradicated the Christian populations
of the East; and it is a question for grave
thought, as to whether our free and enlightened
Government, during the half-century that it has had
control over our actions in the East, has been as
active and as influential as the Company of Turkey
Merchants, who could draw the sword as well as the
purse-strings, and were not hampered by the parsimonious
feelings of those who have to draw up an
economical budget to present to the people whose
goodwill they wish to retain.</p>

after reciting the Letters Patent of James I, and the
subsequent Acts relating to the Levant trade, recites
that it would be beneficial that the exclusive rights and
privileges of the Company should cease and determine,
and that ‘the said Governor and Company are willing
and desirous to surrender up the said Letters Patent
into His Majesty’s hands’. In pursuance of this Act a
deed was forthwith executed surrendering the Letters
Patent to the Crown. One section of the Act is now of
some historical importance. It provided that ‘all such
rights and duties of jurisdiction and authority over His
Majesty’s subjects resorting to the ports of the Levant
for the purposes of trade or otherwise, as were lawfully
exercised and performed’ by the Company’s consuls,
should thenceforth be exercised or performed ‘by any
consuls or other officers respectively as His Majesty
may be pleased to appoint for the protection of the
trade of His Majesty’s subjects in the ports and places,
etc.’ This was the first statutory assignment to Royal
consuls of jurisdiction in places outside the dominions
of the Crown. From this Act sprang in due time the
Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1843 (now replaced by that
of 1890), under which British subjects and British protected
persons enjoy the protection of British courts of
law in almost every independent Oriental country from
Morocco to Corea, and by means of which the foundations
of law and order are being laid in the great
protectorates of Africa.”</p>

<p>A brefe Relation of my Travell<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> from
The Royall Cittie of London towardes
The Straites of Mariemediteranum, and

<p>The shipp whearin I was to make my
voyege to Constantinople, Lyinge at
Graves ende, I Departed from Londone
in a pare of ores, with my
chiste and suche provition as I had
provided for that purpose, the
nynthe of Februarie 1598 (1599), being Frydaye.</p>

<p>Comminge to Graves ende, I wente aborde our shipp,
Called the Heckter, and thare placed my chiste, my bedinge,
and a pare of virginals,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which the martchantes did
alow me to carrie, for my exersize by the waye. Other
comoditis I carriede none, savinge one grose of tin spounes,
the which coste me nyne shillinges; and thirtie pounde of
tin in bares, which coste me 18<i>s.</i> The shipe beinge verrie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
unreddie, and no cabbins appoynted for passingeres, I was
constrainede to go into the towne for my Lodginge and
Diette, till the thirtenthe Daye in the After nowne, at
which time anker was wayed and we under sayle, untill we
came to Deale Castell.</p>

<p>Cominge to Deale Castell, thare we came to an anker,
for the wynde sarved not to pass by Dover. Thar our ship
stayed fouer dayes for a wynde. In the meane time we
wente a shore into the towne of Deale, and also to Sandwiche,
to make our selves merrie. When the wynde came
fayer, it was in the nyghte, and diverse of us that weare
passingers, and also som saylers, weare in the towne of
Deale, wheare som of our company had dranke verrie
moche, espetialy one of our five Trumpeters, who, beinge
in Drinke, had Lockid his Chamber dore; and when he
that came from the ship to call us went under his chamber
wyndoe and caled him, he Came to the wyndoe and insulted
him; whear upon we wente all a waye a borde our
ship, and lefte that Dronkerde be hinde. Thar the wynde
sarvinge well, we sayled merraly by Dover, and so a longe
the Sleve.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>But beinge aboute 30 leages at sea, sodonly thare cam a
contrarie wynde, the which did prove a marvalus greate
storme for the space of eyghte and fortie houres. In the
nyghte we did not only louse our pinis caled the Lanerett,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
who was to goo with us to the gulfe of Venis, but we also
loste our selves, not knowinge whear we weare by Reason
the fogge was so greate that we could se no son. When it
began anythinge to cleare, we founde our selves to be harde
upon the ponie stones<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> betwyxt Ingland and Ierlande, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
verrie dangerus place. Than our mariners did Labur to
gitte into the mayn otion againe, but the storme not
altogether seacinge, but the foge more Increasinge, we
wear the next Daye at a non plus againe, not knowinge
wheare we weare, but beinge under sayle, and the foge
verrie thicke. Upon a sodon we saw the seae breake a
gainste the shore, the which was verrie greate Rockes, and
we weare so neare the shore that it was not possible to
caste aboute in time to save ourselves from shipwracke, but
it pleased almyghtie God so to defend us from harme that
we weare juste befor the harbur at Dartmouthe, a verrie
straite entrie betwyxte greate Rockes that ar on bothe
sides of that entrie. Than weare we all verrie joyfull, and
entred in thare verrie willingly. Thare we stayed four
dayes. In the meane time the Mr.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and Martchantes sent
postes aboute to all the haven townes upon that coste to
inquier of our pinis, the Lanerett. In the End word was
brought that presently, after the storme, 3 or 4 sayle of
Dunkerkes<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> had her in chace, and in the storme her topmaste
was broken, so that, to save her selfe from beinge
taken, she Ron a shore at Falmouthe. Havinge thar goten
a new topmaste, she sente word by the mesinger that she
would meet us in Plimmouthe sounde. This worde beinge
broughte, Anker was wayed, and we under sayell; when we
cam Ryghte before Plimmouthe a peece was discharged to
call our pinis; but even at that time the wynd came contrarie,
so that we moste needes also goo in thare, and cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to an anker in Catt water, wheare we founde our pinis.
Thare we stayed sevene dayes for a wynde.</p>

<p>The 16th day of Marche, beinge verrie could wether, the
wynde came fayer, and as we weare under sayle in
Plimmouthe-sounde, thare came in a litle carvell<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> with salte,
who no sonner was come to the shore, and hearinge the
name of our shipe, but they caused a parlie to be sounded
be a trumpett, whearupon sayle was storouk, and tow
sailers of that carvell came aborde our shipe, advisinge our
Mr. not to goo to seae with oute good store of companye;
for they wente to seae in a man of ware from Plimmouthe,
caled the Plow, and theye weare taken by seven sayell of
Dunkerkes, who Did straitly examon them if they could
tell weare the Heckter was, or whether she weare gone her
voyage or no, but they protested that they never hard of
suche a shipp. Som of these men thei put to death, to
feare otheres. Whate they did with the Reste of theire
men they knew not. They touke theire ship from them,
and gave sixe of them that litle carvell to bringe them
home.</p>

<p>When our Mr. and captaine had harde these men speake,
he toulde them that he would not staye one hour for any
more companye than God alreddie had sente him, the which
was only our pinis and tow shipes that weare goinge for
New found Land, and for there owne saftie mad haste after
us. Saylinge forthe before a faire wynde, our ship sayled
so well that we could spare the pinis our mayne saile, and
yeate the nexte morninge our pinnis was verrie far behind.
Aboute 8 of the clocke, one in our maine tope discried 3
sayle, the which did ly close by our fore porte a little after;
he saw four more, which lay the same cource, and these
weare the seven sayell which we weare tould of. Than we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
began to Louke aboute us, our goneres made Reddie there
ordinance, our faightes<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> oute, and everie man his bandaleare<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and muskett. We hade the wynde of them, and needed
not to have spoken with them, but our Captaine thoughte
it not fitt to show our selves fearfull or cowardly; Leaste
the wynde should sodonly turne, or scante upon us, and our
flyinge would incurridge our enemyes to com the more
bouldly upon us. Than he caled the botson and bid him
beare towardes them, the which he willingly wente aboute;
so we bore Towardes them, and when we came so neare
them that we myghte well disarne the hulke of there
amberall and of their vizamberall, and they cam bouldly
upon us, our Mr. bide the botswayne stow them a brood
side; for our mayne sayle was so brode, that they could not
se the stoutnes of our ship; for may hape, cothe he (mayhap,
quoth he), they may take our ship to be one of the Quen’s,
and yf we doo hapen to heale them, or theye us, they which
make answer maye say our ship is caled the Seven stars, for
the quene as yeate hathe none of that name; but assowne as
they sawe the brode side of our ship, thinking us in dede
to be one of the Quene’s ships, they presently turned them
aboute to flye away. Than we gave chace to them, havinge
almoste loste sighte of our pinis, and all other shipes
savinge those which we gave chace unto. They made all
the sayle they coulde, and yeat with in halfe an hour we
weare come with in shott of them. Than our captain bid
the Mr. goner give them a chace peece<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> shout at the amberall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
but hitt him not, so the Mr. goner gave him a shott cloce
by his fore bowe<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; yeat would they nether strike sayle, nor
show any flagge, but made away with all the sayle they
had, drablings<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and topgalands, but all would not serve
their turne, for we came nearer and nearer unto them.
Than our Mr. bid the goner shoute throughe the amberall
his maynsayle, and so he did verrie near her drablinge.
Than the Amberall, vise amberall, Rear amberall, and one
more shoute the mayn topp; but at that time they hade the
wyndie side of us, though we weare com unto them, yeat no
man would once show himselfe. Than the booteson of our
ship stod upon our spar decke,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> with his sorde drawne in
his hande, commandinge them to come under our Lee side.
The which verrie unwillingly they dide, yeate no man
would show himselfe. Now we beinge verrie neare the
coste of Spayne (or France) he tackte about againe to goo
his Ryghte cource, and all this seven sayell did follow us;
than our Mr. caled unto the amberall him selfe, comanding
them to caste oute the bote and com abord us (or eles he
would sinke them); after so callinge twyse unto them, one
that semed by his spetche to be a Ducheman, answered,
we woll, we woll, but Longe it was before the boote came
forthe, yeat at laste there bote came forthe, and the
captaine of that shipe, with 4 saylers to Row the bote,
wente a borde the wise amberall, and there stayed halfe an
houre. Than those thre captaines came a borde our shipe;
now all this whyle we weare saylinge our courc, and all
these seven shipes durst do no other but follow us.
When these thre captaines came aborde us, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
our company saw one of them have under his arme a good
long mony bage full of somthinge, and so they wente with
the Mr. of our ship into his cabin, and talked a good whyle.
In the meane time the sayleres which broughte these
captaynes a borde, standinge on our hatchis, and our
saylers Loukinge upon them, one of our men sayde, surly I
should know this fellow, for he is an Inglishman. That
man presently answered, swearinge a greate othe, and sayde
that he was no Inglishman, nether could speak one worde
of Inglishe; and yeat he spoke as good Inglishe as any of
us. Than one of our maysteres mates, our pursser and
boteson touke theyr boote, and foure of our owne sayleres,
and wente a borde thre or foure of those shipps; and in
that meane time, our Mr. and the 3 captaines havinge well
talked of the mater, our Mr. cam forthe of his cabbin and
strode upon the sparr decke, causing all our company to be
caled before him, did Reed a letter which semed to be but
newly wrytten; the efeckte of that letter was as yf it had
bene made as a pass from the kinge of France, with sartayne
wynes which the captaynes sayde weare a borde ther
shipes. But whyle he was a Reeding that Letter, our
mysteres mate, purser, and bootson came frome the shipps
and sayd they weare men of warre, Laden with nothinge but
men, soulders, musketes, Raperes and dagers, sheldes and
buckeleres, and ment nothinge so moche as to have taken
us; but our maister havinge alreddie taken the prise in his
cabbin, seemed to be verrie angrie with his mate and the
purser for sayinge so, he havinge a letter to show the contrarie;
so he discharged the captayn and let the shipes go,
the which greved the sayeleres and the Reste of our company
verrie moche. Yf he had done, as he myghte verrie
well have done, broughte these seven sayle as a prise into
Inglande, it would have bene the braveste sarvis that ever
any Inglishe marchante shipe did, and tharby have Reaped

that those seven saile, after they escaped from us, and
before our coming home, they had taken and Robed
upon the seae, betwyxt London and New Castell, thre
score sayle of Inglishe and other contrie ships.]</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Marche 1599.</span></h4>

<p>The 20th Day, the wynde sarvinge well, we paste the
Northe Cape, and entered the bay of Portingale. The 23
we Recovered the Soothe Cape. Than we weare becalmed
for a time. The 24 thare came an Infinite company of
porposis aboute our ship, the which did leape and Rone (run)
marvalusly. The 25 we saw 2 or 3 greate monstrus fishis
or whales, the which did spoute water up into the eayere,
lyke as smoke dothe assend out of a chimnay. Sometime
we myghte se a great parte of there bodye above the
water. The calme did yeat continue. The 27, havinge a
verrie fayer wynde, the which did blow a good gale aboute
12 or one of the clocke, we entered the straytes of Marie-medeteranum
in Dispite of our enymyes. At the entrie it
is butt 3 Leages at the moste from shore to shore. In my
thinkinge it seemed not to be above 3 myles, but the
Reason of yt is because the Lande is verrie hie on bothe
sides, Spayne on our Lefte hand, and Barberie of the
Ryghte. On Spayne side we did se a verrie fayer towne
or cittie, caled Tarrefe,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the which stood verrie pleasantlye
close to the seae. On Barbarie side Thar is a myghtie
mountayn of Rockes, the which theye do call Ape hill.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> 7
Leages further, on Spayne side, thar is a verrie strone (strong)
towne Caled Jebbatore.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This towne Lay verrie fayer to
our vew. It is verrie well fortified, and of greate strengthe.
Thare dothe also Ly a greate number of the king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Spayens gallies and men of warr, to keepe the straites. On
the easte side of the towne tharis a greate mountayne,
wheare on a great parte of the towne dothe stande. This
mountayne is verrie upryghte on bothe sides, but on the
easte sid it is so uprighte that no man can go to the top
of it. It standes cross wyse to the seae. On the fore end
tharis a stronge bullworke, by which means the towne is
more secure.</p>

<p>We sett oute from Plimmouthe the 16th of Marche,
havinge than verrie could wether, and no sine of any
grene thinge on trees or hedgis; and the 27, at the entringe
of the straites, the wether was exsedinge hoote, and we
myghte se the feeldes on bothe sides verrie grene, and the
tres full blowne, the which unto me was a verrie greate
wonder to finde suche an alteration in a 11 dayes. Ryghte
over againste Jeblatore, on Barbarie side, thar is a towne
verrie fayer to our vew, caled Shutte.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This towne is
waled aboute, and the feldes about it verrie pleasante, and
of good soyle.</p>

<p>Thoughe on bothe sides of seae tharis hudge mountains
and Raged Rockes, on the Easte end of this towne a litle
tharis a Large and stronge bullworke (or forte), and the
Lyke is on the weste side. The kinge of Spayne Dothe
also houlde that toune, beinge in Barberie.</p>

<p>A litle further on the Coste of Spayne thar is a Towne
caled Marvels,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but I could not well disarne it for the fogge
which at that time Laye upon the seae. The nexte towne
is caled grand Malligan,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and than Sallabrin,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> which towne
is fortie Leages easte of Jeblatore.</p>

<p>The 28 of Marche we sayled still a longe by the shore
of Spayne, wheare we myghte se upon hudg mountaynes
great store snowe that Dothe ly thare contenually, and
yeate in the vallies below it is verrie hote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The 29th daye we sayled by the shore of Africa.</p>

<p>The 30th daye we entered into a harber in Barberia,
Caled Argeare.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>When we weare upon the sea before the towne it made a
verrie fayer show. It Lyethe cloce to the seae, upon a
verrie upryghte hill. The towne in proportion is Lyke a
top sayle. It is verrie strongly waled about with tow
wales and a dich.</p>

<p>The housis be bulte of Lyme and stone. The greateste
parte of the towne, or housis in the towne, have flatt
Roufes, covered artifitialy with playster of paris. A man
beinge on the topp of one house may goo over the greateste
parte of the towne. Diverse of the streetes ar verrie narrow
and uneasie goinge in them, for the towne standes upon
Rockes. Above the towne, upon the top of the hill, thar is
a castell, the which may comande the Roode, or a parte of
the seae before the towne. Almoste a myle from that
castell into the contriewardes thare is an other castell, the
which is gardede or kepte by a sartaine number of souldieres;
but, as farr as I could Learne, it is but only to
keepe the heade of there springes of water, which com to
there fountaines in the town, for the Turkes Drinke
nothinge but water; and they saye that hors and man
maye goo under, or in the earthe, from that castell to the
towne. I and 3 or 4 more wente yeat a myle further into
the contrie, wheare we saw another castell, the which, as we
did thinke, was made for the same use. We went so farr
into the contrie at the Requeste of Mr. Chancie, who was
our fysition and surgin for the seae. He wente to gather
som harbs and Routes. This dai being the Laste Day of
Marche, it was a wonder to us to se how forwarde the
springe was: trees and hedgis wear full blowne, corne,
wheate, and barly shott, yong oringis and apples upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
trees; and cominge againe into the towne, we mett Mores
and other people drivinge assis laden with grene beanes,
to be sould in the markett. As they went a Longe the
streete, they often would cale to the people, and say,
balocke, balocke, that is to saye, bewarr, or take heede. We
saw diverse Moores com in riding, all naked, savinge a
litle clothe before them like a childe’s apron. Som of them
did carrie a darte, otheres a bowe and arros.</p>

<p>There be also a greate number of Jewes, but the greateste
nomber be Turkes.</p>

<p>The toune or cittie is verrie full of people, for it is a
place of great trad and marchandise. They have tow
markett dayes in the weeke, unto the which do com a great
number of people out of the mountaines and other partes
of the contrie, bringinge in great store of corne and frute
of all sortes, and fowle, bothe wylde and tame. Thar be
great store of partridgis and quales, the which be sould
verrie cheape, a partridge for less than one pennye, and 3
quales at the same price. Thar be also great store of
henes and chickins, for they be hatchte by artificiall
meanes, in stoves or hote housis, without the helpe of a
hen. The maner of it I cannot at this time playnly
discribe, but heareafter I may, yf God permitte.</p>

<p>They have also greate store of Camels, assis, asnegoes,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
oxon, horsis, and som dromedaries. Thar be a greate
number of Turks that be but Renied<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> cristians of all nations.
Som, but moste are Spanyardes, Italians, and other Ilands
adjoyninge, who, when they be taken, ar compelled so to
doo, or els to live in moche more slaverie and myserie.
But, in prosis of time, these Renied cristians do become
most berberus and villanus, taking pleasur in all sinfull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
actions; but that which is worste of all they take moste
delite in, and that is, Theye proule aboute the costes of
other contries, with all the skill and pollacie thei can, to
betraye cristians, which they sell unto the Moors and other
marchantes of Barbarie for slaves.</p>

<p>Thare ar in this toune great store of hote houses, or
bathes, the which they call bangowes,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and also cooke’s
housis, that dress meate verrie well.</p>

<p>The next day after we came into the Roode, the kinge
sent worde to our captaine that he should come unto him
and bringe with hime the presente which he had to carrie
unto the Grand Sinyor; so our captaine wente unto him
and tould the kinge That the presente which he carried to
the grand sinyor was not only a thinge of greate substance
and charge, but allso it was Defficulte curios, and
would aske a longe time to put it together, and make it
fitt to be sene. When the kinge understode whate our
captaine had saide, he would give no cridite unto his
wordes, but kepte him as a prisner, and caused me and my
mate to be sente for. When we came before him, and
wear examened, he found us to be in the same tale that
our captaine had toulde; and than was our captane
Released and we discharged, and the kinge sente our
captaine for a presente a borde our shipe tow buls and
thre sheepe, the which weare verrie leane, for they do
thinke the worste thinges they have is tow good for
cristians. They ar all in generall verrie covitus, and use
all the pollacie they can to gitt from the cristians, lawfully
or unlawfully, as moche as they maye.</p>

<p>The Turkishe and Morishe weomen do goo all wayes in
the streetes with there facis covered, and the common reporte
goethe thare that they beleve, or thinke that the
weomen have no souls. And I do thinke that it weare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
well for them if they had none, for they never goo to
churche, or other prayers, as the men dothe. The men ar
verrie relidgus in there kinde, and they have verrie faire
churchis, which they do call mosques.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Of the Further Procession of our Navigation.</span></h4>

<p>We departed from the Cittie of Argier the fourthe of
Aprill, saylinge still near the Coste or shore of Africa.
20 leages from Argere Thare is a faire towne caled Teddell,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
but we sailed afar of from it. We also passed by a litle
towne calede Budgge,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> under a hudge mountaine, risinge hie,
and picked lyke a suger lofe. Som of our navigateres saide
that at this place St Augustine did sometime keepe a
scoule or exersise. It is 30th leagues from Argere towardes
the easte on the same side.</p>

<p>The seventhe of Aprill beinge Easter eve, we saw verrie
strainge lyghtninge in the skie, or in the eire. It was verrie
wonderfull and strainge, for we myghte se the eayre open
and a fier lyke a verrie hote iron taken out of a smythe’s
forge, somtimes in liknes of a roninge worme, another time
lyke a horsshow, and agine lyke a lege and a foute. Also
the Thunder clapes weare also exseding greate. The
seventhe daye we passed by a place caled Morrottome.
The 18th, by a hudge mountaine, which is an Ilande in the
seae, close by the shore. This ilande is called Simberrie.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Upon that shore, over againste it, was somtime the Cittie of
Carttag, but some wryteres caled it Carthage. Aboute
five leagues further we sawe the cape, or forte, caled Debone.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
At the weste sid of it thar is a greate and large Tovne,
caled Tonis,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> by some peopell Thunes. Thare dothe lye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
some parte of the Turkes gallis. The 14th we sayelled by
a famous iland Caled Sissillia,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> cloce by the shore of it.
This ilande, they saye, is threscore leages in lengthe; a
verrie frutfull and pleasante iland. It dothe yelde greate
store of corne and all maner of frute. At the weste End
Thare Dothe alwayes ly at the leaste nyne gallies, and at
the weste end ten or more.</p>

<p>Neare unto the easte ende of this Cissillie there is a verrie
heie mountayne, the which they do cale Montabell, but the
ryghte name of it is mounte Ettna. In the Daye time we
that sayle by it maye se the topp of it covered with snow,
but in the nyghte we did see manye flashis of fiere, to our
thinkinge about the mydle of the mountaine. This brave
ilande is under the kinge of Spayne. We did leave it upon
our lefte hand. Than, upon our ryghte hande, we saw
another ilande, which is caled Malta, and that is likewyse
under the kinge of Spayne, and is now kept for the quantati
(<i>sic</i>) the Master of the Roodes,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> so that the Turkes can
hardly pass that waye. A litle before we cam so farr as
Malta, we gave chace to a shipe, beinge the 15th daye.
After the mayster of that shipp parsaved by our flage
whate we weare, and did se that thre suche as him selfe
was not able to contende with us, he caste out his boote and
came a borde us, and broughte with him for a presente
diverse Comodities: som turkie carpites, some quiltede
Coveringes of watchat<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> silke, and tow or thre great peecis
of salte fishe that wear 7 or 8 foute longe and one foute
square. It was strainge fishe unto us. We never tasted it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
for after he that broughte it had talked privetly with our
mayster, he gave him leve to Departe, and to take all his
presente with him; but it muche greved our sayles (sailors),
for som offesers of our shipp wente aborde that shipp
whyles he was talkinge with our mayster, and they founde
by the pursseres bouke that theye had ten thousand
Dolleres worthe of Spaynishe goodes a borde. But our
Mr. having recaved som secrite bribe, he sayed that the
shipe and good came from Sio,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> wheare Mr. Willyam Auldridge
was consell, with other idle reasons, and tharfore he
would not take anythinge from him; and so the ship
went awaye. Than we paste by Malta. The 17th daye
we gave chace to another shipp of Massillia,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and borded
here, but had litle or nothinge from her. Than we crost
the gulfe of Venis.</p>

<p>The 19th we discried lande in Gricia.</p>

<p>The 20th daye we paste by Saffranee, leavinge it on our
lefte hande. At this porte of Saffranee<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> thare be tow
tounes, and a moste singuler good harber. Neare unto it is
the iland caled Sante, but rether Zante. The same Daye we
came to an anker before the greate toune of that ilande, the
which theye Do call Zante, by the name of the ilande;
thar is also a good harbur. The toune or Cittie of Zante
is Cittiwated cloce to the seae, and is a good myle in
lengthe; behinde it, upon a verrie hie and stepie hill, Dothe
stande a large platforme of a castell, whearin Dothe live the
governer of that castell and towne; he is caled the Providore.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Within the wales of this castell is diverse other
dwelers, and many housis; within that place the Providore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
dothe tow dayes in the weeke hould a courte, and heare
diverse causes, as well of the Grekes as of the Venition
and Italians; for this ilande is under the Ducke of Venis,
but he houldes it under the greate Turke, and Dothe
paye tribute yearlye or quarterly for it. The greateste
parte of the people in this ilande be Greekes, and theye
doo labur harde in planting and triminge the corron (currant)
gardins, ollive gardins, and vinyards. Hear growethe
verrie litle corne, but from hence comethe the moste of
our Corrance and beste ayle (oil); thar is also good
wyne. There provition of breade, beefe, gotese, shepe, and
swyne and pullin (fowls), they have it from Castle Turne<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
in Morea, the which place is neare the playnes of Arcadia,
whear plentie of catle ar. The Providore, and those which
ar nexte unto him in office, whome they do cale sinyors of
healthe, would not suffer us to com on shore because we
came from Argeare, whear Turks do live, and we broughte
from thence som Turkes in our shipp; yeate, at the End of
six dayes, we had proticke,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> which is, Leve to com a shore.
The order thar is, that all Those which doo com out of any
parte of Turkie, havinge not a letter of healthe from som
Venition or Ittalion, muste remayne ether a borde the ship,
or in the prison which they do cale the lazerett, for ten
Dayes; yf in the meane time any man hapene to be sicke,
they muste all reste thare for ten dayes more, and so still
for ten Dayes untill the have there healthe.</p>

<p>Whyleste we laye thus for sixe dayes upon the seae
before the towne, I touke greate notis of a little mountayne,
the which, as I thought, did ly close to the seae, and
semed to be a verrie pleasante place to take a vew of the
whole iland and the seae before it. It showed to be verrie
greene and playen ground on the tope of it, and a whyte
thinge lyke a rocke in the mydle tharof. I touke suche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pleasur in behouldinge this hill that I made a kinde of vow
or promise to my selfe that assowne as I sett foute on
shore I would nether eate nor Drinke untill I had bene on
the tope tharof; and in the meane time did labur with tow
of my companyons, and perswaded them to beare me company.
One of there names was Myghell Watson, my
joyner; the other’s name Edward Hale, a Cotchman. The
day beinge come that we should go a shore, I chalinged
my associates with there promise, and gott there good wils
to go with me before we wente into the towne. This hill is
called by the Greekes Scopo (<i>i.e.</i>, outlook). It is from the
town more than a myle, but I gave our sayleres somthinge to
carrie us in the coke boote, as we thoughte to the foute of
the hill; but when we weare sett a shore we found it to be
almoste tow myles unto it. When we cam to the foute of
it, by greate fortune we hapened on the ryghte waye, the
which was verrie narrow and crouked. It was arlye in the
morninge, and we weare toulde, 2 or 3 dayes before, that no
man muste carrie any weapern with him when he wente
a shore, and tharfore we wente only with cudgels in our
handes. So, assendinge the hill aboute halfe a myle, and
loukinge up, we sawe upon a storie of the hill above us a
man goinge with a greate staffe on his shoulder, havinge a
clubed end, and on his heade a cape which seemed to hus
to have five horns standinge outryghte, and a greate heard
of gootes and shepe folloed him.</p>

<p>My frende Myghell Watson, when he saw this, he
seemed to be verrie fearfull, and would have perswaded us
to go no farther, tellinge us that surly those that did inhabite
thare weare savidge men, and myghte easalye wronge
us, we hauinge no sordes or dageres, nether any more
Company; but I tould him that yf thei weare divers, I
would, with Godes help, be as good as my worde. So, with
muche adow, we gott him to go to that storie wheare we
sawe the man with his club; and than we saw that that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
man was a heardman. Yeate, for all this, Myghell Watson
swore that he would goo no farther, com of it what would.
Edward Hale sayd somthinge fayntly that he would not
leave me, but se the end. So we tow traveled forwarde,
and when we cam somthinge neare the topp, we saw tow
horsis grasinge, with packe sadls on ther backes, and one
man cominge downe the hill towardes us, having nothinge
in his handes. Cothe I to my fellow: Nede, we shall see
by this man what people they be that inhabit heare.
When this man came unto us he lay his hand upon his
breste, and boued his head and bodye with smylinge countinance,
makinge us a sine to go up still. Yeat than Ned
Hall began to diswade me from goinge any further; but I
tould him it would not stand with my othe to go backe
untill I had bene as farr as I could go. Cominge to the
top thare was a prittie fair grene, and on one sid of it a
whyte house bulte of lyme, and some square, the whyche
had bene the house of an ancoriste, who, as I harde after
wardes, Died but a litle before our cominge thether, and
that she had lived five hundrethe years. Ryghte before us,
on the farther side of the greene, I saw a house of som 20
pacis longe, and waled aboute one yarde hie, and than
opene to the eaves, which was aboute a yarde more. And
I se a man on the inside reatche oute a coper kettell to one
that stood with oute the wale. Than saide I to Ned Hale:
I will go to yender house and gitt som drinke, for I have
greate neede. The wether was verrie hote, and I was
fastinge. But Ned Hale tould me that I had no reason to
drinke at there handes, nether to go any nearer them.
Yeate I wente bouldly to the sid of the house, whear I
saw another man drinke, and made a sine to him within
that I woulde drinke. Than he touke up the same ketle
which had water in it, and offer it me to drinke. And
when I did put out my hande to take it, he would
not give it me, but sett it further of, and than cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
near the wale againe, and lifte up a carpit which lay
on the ground, and thar was six bottels full of verrie good
wyne, and a faire silver cupe, and he filed that silver boule
full of a redeishe wyne, which they do cale Rebola, and he
gave it me to drinke; and when I had it in my hande
I caled to my frende Nede Hale, who stood a far of, for he
was a fraide to com neare. Hear, Nede, cothe I, a carrouse
to all our frendes in Inglande. I pray you, cothe he, take
heede what you dow. Will you take what drinke they
give you? Yeae, truly, cothe I; for it is better than
I have as yeat disarved of. When I had give God thankes
for it, I drank it of, and it was the beste that ever
I dranke. Than he filled me the same boule with whyte
Rebola, the which was more pleasante than the other.
When I had muche comended the wyne, and tould Ned
Hale that he was a foule to refuse suche a cup of wyne,
than he come neare the house, and desiered to have som
water; so he had the kettle to drinke in. When this was
all done, I was so well pleasede with this entertaynmente,
that I knew not how to thanke this man. I had no mony
aboute me but one halfe Dolor of Spanyshe mony, and
that mony is best accepted of in that countrie. I offered
to give that peece of silver to this man, but he would not
by any means take it. Than I remembered that I had tow
severall (Seville?) knyfes in my pocket. I toke one of them
and gave it him, and the blad gilded and graven. When
he had taken it oute of the sheathe and louked upon it, he
caled with a loude voyce: Sisto, Sisto! Than another man
Came runninge, unto whom he showed but only the hafte
of it, and than they began to wrastell for the knife; but
he that I gave it unto kepte it, and leape ower the wale to
the side whear I was, and, bowinge him selfe unto me, he
toke me by the hande, and led me aboute by the ende of
that house, and so into a litle cloyster, throughe the
whyche we passed into a Chappell, whear we found a preste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
at mass and wex candls burninge. He pute me into
a pue, whear I satt and saw the behaveour of the people,
for thare weare about 20 men, but not a woman emongste
them; for the wemen weare in a lower chapell by them
selves,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> yeate myghte they heare and se. Ned Hale cam
after, but hauinge loste sighte of me, at his cominge into
the chappell he kneled Downe neare unto the wemen, but
saw them not; but they saw him, and wondred at his
behaveour; for, after I had kneeled Downe, I stode up in
my pue to louk for him, and than I saw tow wemen put
oute there heades and laughed at him—as indeed they
myghte, for he behaved him selfe verrie foolishly. Nether
he nor I had ever sene any parte of a mass before, nether
weare we thinge the wyser for that. This chapell was verrie
curiusly paynted and garnished round aboute, as before
that time I had never seene the lyke. Sarvis beinge
ended, we Departed out of the chapell; but presently one
cam after us, who did seme verrie kindly to intreat me to
goo backe againe, and he leed us throughe the chappell
into the cloyster, wheare we found standing eyghte verrie
fayre wemen, and rychly apparled, som in reed satten, som
whyte, and som in watchell Damaske,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> there heads verrie
finly attiered, cheanes of pearle and juels in there eares,
7 of them verrie yonge wemen, the eighte was Anchante
(ancient), and all in blacke. I thoughte they hade bene
nones, but presently after I knewe they wear not. Than
weare we brought into that house wheare before I had
dranke. Clothe beinge layde, we weare requested to sitt
downe, and sarved with good breade and verrie good
wyne and egges, the shels of them collored lyke a
damaske Rose,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and these mad lyke an alla compana
(<i>alla campagna</i><a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>) Route, for they keep it in the earthe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
because nothinge will thar take salte. My fellow, Need
Hale, would nether eate nor drinke anythinge but water,
yeat I did eate one egge, bread and chese, and I dranke
tow boules of wyne. Whylste we satt there, the Jentelwemen
came in, and thre of them came verrie neare
us, and louked earnestly upon us. I offered one of them
the cup to drinke, but she would not. Than I offered to
give him that tended upon us my halfe Dollor, but he
would not take any monye. These wemen standing all to
gether before us, I thoughte they had bene Dwelleres
there, because no mony would be taken. I presented my
other knyfe, of 2<i>s.</i> price, unto the ould Jentlewoman, the
which she was unwilling to take, but at laste she tooke it,
and than they all flocked together, and, as it semed to me,
they wondered muche at it. When thei had well louked
upon it, they came altogether towardes me and bowed
there bodies, to show ther thankfulnes. So Ned Hale and
I Touke our leves and wente awaye verrie merrily; but
when we came to the place wheare we lefte our fainte-harted
frend Myghell Watson, who all this whyle has
layen in a bushe, when we had tould him the wonderes
that we had sene, and of our kinde entertainmente, he
would not beleve us, for he was a shamed, and desiered us
to make haste to the towne that he myghte git som vittals;
but we mad the less haste for that, and wente to se another
monestarie. Near unto the place upon this mountaine
growed many sweete floweres, in stead of heathe, time, and
other good earbes, and fine springes of watere. Cominge
to the towne of Zante, we Inquiered out the house wheare
our marchants and other passingeres weare, which was at
the sine of the Whyte Horse; but Myghell Watson, for
shame, would not go in with us. When our martchantes
saw us, they began to be verrie angrie, sayinge that they
had soughte alaboute, and thoughte that we had bene
drowned, or com to som evell fortune; but I bid them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hould ther peace, and lett me tell them my adventurs.
When I had toulde them all the storie, they wondered at
my bouldnes, and some Grekes that weare thare sayde
that they never hard that any Inglishe man was ever thare
before. It was than aboute 12 of the clocke, and nyne
of these Jentlmen would needes go presently thether to se
That which I had done, and because I would not go againe,
beinge wearie, for it was 4 myles thether, they hiered a gide,
and yeate, when they came to the mountaine, they myste
of the Ryghte way, and did climbe upon the Rockes, so
that som of them gott fales and broke there shins; but at
laste they got thether, and the waye for them by me
beinge preparede, thei weare bid verrie welcom; but there
gide hade Instrucktede them with that which I never thought
on, the which was, that at ther firste cominge they should
go Into the chappell, and thar offer som mony, as litle as
they would, and than theye should have all kinde entertainmente.
So, verrie late in the evininge, they Returned
safly againe, and gave me thankes for that which theye
had sene.</p>

<p>The 30th day I wente with 3 more, havinge a Greke to
show us the way into the Castle.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Maye.</span></h4>

<p>The firste day of maye we saw there greatest traverses<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
or sportes that they have in all the yeare, for that day
dothe meete at the toune of Zante all the able men of the
Greeks with there best horsis and artillerie, which is nothinge
but staves to Rvne at the Ringe, or at quintan.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> They
borroed our five trompateres to sounde whe[n] they Run at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Ringe the prizis; the maner of it was so simple, that it
is not worthe keping in memorye. In the fore noune they
Run Quintan for a prize, the after noone at Ringe.</p>

<p>The second of Maye we departed from Zante.</p>

<p>The Turkes which weare passingeres in our shipp, and
came with us from Argeare in Barbaria, and were to goo
wythe us to Scandarowne, did somwate hasten us on of
our voyege, and, the wynd beinge fayer, we sett sayle the
second of Maye. The sam daye we sailed verrie neare an
Ilande called Travallie,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in the which we did se a Castle,
and in that Castell, or in som monestarie near unto it, thar
be alwayes Thirtie fryeres, and no wemen in that Ilande,
nether any more housis: it is low ground and levell, and
litle above one myle in lengthe.</p>

<p>The third Daye we Entered in betwyxte Neagraponte,
the mayne land of Grece, and a fine Iland called Sireego.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
They saye that in this Iland faire Hellin was borne, and
from thence stolne awaye before the Distrucktion of
Troye.</p>

<p>The fourthe and the fifte Daye, havinge but a litle gale
of wynde, we sayled cloce by the shore of Candie. This
Ilande is fiftie leages in lengthe. We sayled neare unto
that highe hill Caled Crete, wheare St. Pale preachede,
and an ould Jue That was a passinger in our ship tould us
that on the tope of that hill Dothe stand a brason man
houldinge a bowe bente as yf he wear shoutinge againste
the easte, and he sayd that it was placed thare by arte
magick, before which time few ships could live upon those
seaes, the Easterly wyndes weare so furius; but sence that
time they have bene as other places or seaes ar. Over
aginste Candie we lefte many litle Ilandes, spetialy at the
easte end, Melo and Antimelo.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The sixte Day we had a virrie straite entrie betwyxte
tow Ilandes at aleven of the clocke, and did Run within a
bot lengthe of the shores. They be verrie hudge and upryghte
mountaines. That which we lefte on our Ryghte
hande is calede Cassa,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a place not Inhabbited; the other
upon our lefte hande is caled Scarpanta, and it is Inhabitede.
In this Ilande tharbe verrie greate store of foule, that in
the nyghte time doo Rouste in the grounde as our counis
in Ingland dow.</p>

<p>16 leagues from Thence is the Ile of Roodes, but sence
that Ilande was taken by the Turkes, the Roods<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> hathe bene
kepte by the Spanyarde at Malta.</p>

<p>The seventhe daye we saw the coste of Carmanee.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The 8 and 9 we weare in a maner be calmede. The
tenthe, and eleventhe, and 12th we sayled by the Coste of
Siprus, havinge it upon our lefte hande. Neare unto the
weste ende we saw a towne caled Baffa.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Eyghte leagues
further, at Cape Gata, we sett a man a shore, who was
a Greke, and borne in Siprus, and thare dwelled, but
havinge a brother dwellinge in Candie, whom he had not
in a longe time seene, he gott passage in a shipe to goo
to Candie; but the wynde would not suffer the ship to
tuche thare, but carried that man to Zante, and in 3
monthes space he could not meete wythe any ship to
carrye him backe againe to Candie. When our shipe
came, he hearinge that we weare to sayle by Candie, he
fell at our Maysteres feet, and craved passege in our shipe
thether. So he was taken in. Yeat when we sayled cloce
by the shore of Candie, our Mr. would not land him thare,
but carried him to Siprus, and sett him on shore thare;
the which I thought was the man’s hard fortun, and so he
thoughte himselfe, for he wepte bitterly, because he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
spente so muche time, and could not se his brother, whom
he so dearly lovede.</p>

<p>Aboute ten leagus from the easte end of this Iland, in
Siprus, near unto Cape Grego, thare is a greate and large
towne caled Famagusta. It is a harber, or good porte.
Thare dothe lye the moste of there gallis and other
shipinge.</p>

<p>The 13th daye we sayled Juste to the easte ende of
Siprus, for the wynde was verrie smale.</p>

<p>This Iland is the moste pleasante of any that hetherto I
did ever see. The shores be lowe, and playne feeldes
risinge into the lande still hier and hier, that a man maye
se neare twentie myles into the Contrie, wheare we sett the
man a shore. We saw great store of wylde swyne; but,
out of all question, it is a verrie fruitful contrie.</p>

<p>When we weare about the mydle of Siprus, we sawe
the Mounte Lebynus, which is in Assirria, and but tow
smale dayes Journaye from Jerusalem. The 14th, havinge
a freshe gale of wynde, we recovered the Cape Cansele,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> the
which is neare unto Scandaroune. The 15th we came to
an anker in the Roode before Scandaroune, the which is in
the verrie bottom of all the straites as farr as any shipp
can go. The 16th daye our Mr. Guner, tow of his mates,
Mr. Chancie, our surgin, one of our Trumpeteres, my selfe,
and my maete, John Harvie, every one of us havinge a
muskett, with powder and shott, we wente ashore, and
though the mountaynes thare be exsedinge heie so that no
ship dare goo within tow myles of the shore, for feare of
not havinge a wynde to carrie them out againe, yet betwyxte
those mountains and the seae there be desarte
placis, thicke woodes, and boges, whearin dothe breed
score of wyld foule, and allso wyld beastes, namely swyne
and foxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>We havinge entred into these woodes, thinkinge to kill
som wylde foule, our myndes wear trabled to find oute
som pathe waye, for feare of tearinge our cloese, and
everie tow or 3 butlengthe<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> (boatlengths) we should finde
a man caled a mountaineard, lyinge in a bushe, havinge in
his hande ether a bowe and arrowes, or eles a peece, the
which weapeins as we supposed they did carrie to kill
wyld foule; but we havinge strayed some thre myles into
the wildernes, we found a square playne, the which was
nothinge but a quagmyer, and in the mydeste thar of was
tow myghtie greate buffelawes, beastes biger then our
greate oxen. At the firste we saw nothinge but there
heades, and they made a great noyse with their snufflinge,
and, in the ende, went Runing awaye, which was a wonder
to us, for had it bene an ox, or cowe, or horse of oures, theye
would thare have bene drowned.</p>

<p>Whylste we stood wondringe at this, we espied a great
companye, to the number of aboute 40, of the afore
sayde mountayneares, the which weare gathered together,
and goinge aboute to catche us by inclosinge us aboute.
This company beinge in that place, we knew not how to
with stand, but only by flyinge away, and the woodes that
weare betwyxte us and the seae weare so heie that we
could not see the seae nor the maste of our shipe; but
Runninge at a ventur throughe thicke and thine, thorns
and bryeres, tearinge our close, at the laste we recovered a
fayer playne, wheare we myghte se our shipe, and within a
myle of the shore. Than weare we glade, and touke our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
ease, wheare we founde a fayre fountaine of verrie comfortable
water, for we weare fastinge, and faynte with
travell.</p>

<p>After we had couled and Refreshed our selves, we Returned
throughe the scatelsteade,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> plat,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> or foundationes of
the towne or cittie of Scandaroune, so caled by the Turkes,
but formerly caled Allicksandretta. There we myghte se
greate peecis of wales wheare goodly housis and monestaris
had bene, which in the same is now nothing but boges
and pondes, wals of housis, and a castle, so sunke into the
grounde with water aboute it that no bodie can go unto it.
We did se thare, upon the wales of an oulde house, verrie
strainge varmente Runing up and downe at great pace,
som of them biger than a great toude, and of the same
collore, but they had longe tayles lyk a Ratt.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Som of
them weare longer maede and less of boddie, and so many
otheres of diveres fations. An other time my mate
Harvie and I wente into the feeldes to washe our lininge,
and, whylste it was a driinge, we went to gather some
fruite, for thar be great store of good frute that is comon,
cominge to a whyte Damson tre. As we were a gatheringe
we espied a great Ader that was in the tre upon the bowes,
at least 12 or 14 foute from the grounde. He was even
Reddie to leape upon one of us. Assown as we turned our
backe to run awaye, He leape oute of the tre, and Rune
into a thickett of brieres. A greate number of suche smale
matteres I will omitte.</p>

<p>The 18th Daye our ship was to be unladen of suche
goodes as was appoynted to goo to Alippo<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>; but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
morninge, as sowne as we weare up, we saw a marvalus
goodly show of tentes upon the sid of that mountayne,
stritchinge downe unto that fountaine which I spoke of
before; the which, when our mayster sawe, he sente a boate
ashore to know the cause; and our marchantes sent him
worde that he should not, by any meanes, send any goodes
or any man a shore untill he did se all the tentes gone, for
thare was the souldieres of Damascus, a parte of the greate
Turkes armye, that weare goinge to the warres, and if
theye did finde any thinge on the shore that did lyke them,
they would tak it as theire owne. So at nyghte we saw
these tentes a takinge up, for, by Reason the contrie is
verrie hote, theye dow travell by nyghte, and not by daye;
so for four dayes there came everie nyghte a fresche companye,
and we kept a borde our shipe. Everie daye thar
would com Ridinge to the seae side a great company of
brave horsmen, with their lancis. Som hade their neagors
to carrie their Lancis and other weapeins. Som sayd that
they weare sent for to Constantinople, the which is 20 dayes
Jurnaye from Scandaroune.</p>

<p>The 30th daye the Franch Consell which is Resedent at
Alippo Dined aborde our shipp.</p>

<p>The same daye, towardes nyghte, our men begann to
unlood our ship of such goodes as was for Alippo, for
souner theye could not well, by Reason of the abbundance
of Jenesaris that passed that waye, and pitched thare tentes
within one myle and halfe of the Roode; and it is a verrie
uncomfortable place. Thare is but 3 houstile,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> one Itallian,
one Franche, and one Inglishe. Some litle cottigis thare
be made of Reedes, lik a somer house, and tow smale
tentes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">June.</span></h4>

<p>The firste of June Thar was letters convayede verrie
straingly from Alippo to Scandaroune, the which is thre
score and twelve myles distance. After I hade bene thare
a litle whyle, I persaved that it was an ordinarie thinge.
For, as we weare sittinge in our marchantes house talkinge,
and pidgons weare a feedinge in the house before us, thare
came a whyte cote pidgon flyinge in, and lyghte on the
grounde amongeste his fellowes, the which, when one of the
marchantes saw, he sayd: Welcom, Honoste Tom, and,
takinge him upe, thare was tied with a thred under his
wynge, a letter, the bignes of a twelve penc., and it was
Dated but four houres before. After that I saw the lyke
done, and alwayes in 4 houres.</p>

<p>The fourthe Daye, in the morninge, thare weare pitched
above twentie tentes at the place afore sayde, but the number
of brave Jenesaries I could not learne, because I could
not be conversante with them, or any that did know it.
The moste of them weare horsmen, and everie man had
his Lance, and most of them his boye, or slave, to beare
his Lance, and everie mane his bowe and quiver of arrowes,
and semeterrie by his sid. Not only there maner of shoutinge,
but ther bowes and arrowes be strainge.</p>

<p>In the time of our being at Scandaroune, our longe
boote wente everie Frydaye to Tharschus,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the cittie or
towne wheare the appstele St. Pale was borne, for that
was ther markett Daye, and she wente to buy vittals.
Tharshus is but 16 myles from Scandaroune, and aboute
the myd waye, or somwhat nearer to Scandarowne, is the
place wheare Jonas<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> was caste out of the whales bellie, as
the Turkes and Greekes tould us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mr. guner of our shipe, one of his mates, my mate
Harvie, and I, with two saylores which Rowed us thether,
we wente to that verrie place, and thare we gathered and
filled a sacke full of sampeare,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> whiche did grow upon those
Rockes.</p>

<p>The tenthe of this monthe we departede from Scandaroune
towardes Constantinople, the wynde beinge direcktly
againste us, bordinge it from shore to shore.</p>

<p>Towardes nyghte we came neare to a fayre towne on our
Ryghte hande; at one end of it thare is a fayre and large
castle, and the towne is a great lengthe by the sea side.
This towne is caled Yeaass,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> about six leagues from Tharesus,
which the Turkes do cale Bayas, for they do chainge
the names of moste townes.</p>

<p>The 12, 13, and 14th we sayled by the coste, and neare
the shore of Carmanye, which is in Asia the Less. The
wynde beinge nothinge favoarable, we had great leasur to
louke upon the shores.</p>

<p>The 15th day we saw Siprus againe.</p>

<p>The 20th daye we Recovered to a Cape, which is one
hundrethe leagues from Scandaroune.</p>

<p>The 23 we sayled by Castle Rosee,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> which is in litle
Asia.</p>

<p>The 25 we sawe a farr of the famus Ilande Called the
Roodes, the which in times paste hathe bene kepte by
Christian Knyghts, but now Inhabited by Turkes.</p>

<p>The 26 we sayled by the shore of the Roods, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
which we tooke sufficiente vew, for the wynde was directly
againste us; we myghte se whear divers fortes hathe bene
upon litle mountayns.</p>

<p>This Ilande is 14 or 15 Leagues in lengthe and four
leagues in bredthe. The 27 we sayled by the northe
ende of the Ilande, and at the northe ende of the Ilande,
and at the northe-easte corner of the same, thar is a towne
or Cittie, the which for Cittiwation and strengthe I cannot
not give it due commendations.</p>

<p>This 27 daye died one Thomas Cable, who was under
20 yearis of age, and son to one of the owneres of our
shipe.</p>

<p>As we weare to pass betwyxt the northe end of the
Ilande and the shore of Asia, which is but 5 leagues
betwyxte, and the wynd direcktly in ye gulfe againste us,
and also we wantede freshe water and other vitals verrie
scarce, our Mr. and marchantes thoughte it good to touche
at the towne.</p>

<p>Cominge to an ankere neare unto the wales of the towne,
thare we founde in the Roode a gallioune of the great
Turkes, the bigeste ship he hathe, aboute one thousand
tun, a verrie carte, a ship of no strengthe; yeat was she
Richly laden, and cam from Alicksandria.</p>

<p>We weare no sowner come to an anker but the Turkes
began to com aborde us, so that the verie firste day thar
came abord us not so few as five hundrethe Rude Turkes,
and lykwyse everie day that we stayed thare they seased
not.</p>

<p>The nexte daye, beinge the 28 of this monthe, the Captaine
basha, governer of the towne, beinge gone abrood
with there galles on some greate busines, the Chia<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> his
Debitie (deputy), who for the time was Captaine, he, with
the chefeest men of the towne, came abord our ship, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
she was trimed up in as handsom maner as we could for
the time. Our gonroume was one of the fayereste Roumes
in the ship, and pleasant to com into. In the gonroume I
had a pare of virginals, the which our Mr. goner, to make
the better showe, desired me to sett them open. When the
Turkes and Jues came in and saw them, they wondered
what it should be; but when I played on them, than they
wondered more. Diveres of them would take me in there
armes and kis me, and wyshe that I would dwell with
them. When the Captaynes Debutie had well vewed our
shipe, the Captaine and Mr. of our shipe, accordinge to the
Custam of the contrie, did give unto this man as muche
brode clothe for a present, as would make his Captaine a
veste or a goune after the Turkie manere; and so they
wente awaye. Assowne as they weare gone, the stuerde
of our ship and his men, my mate Harvie and I, went on
shore to se the towne within. When we came to the gate
wheare we should enter, I louked well upon it, and saw a
superscription wryten or coutt in stone, but I could not
understand it, only the yeare of our Lorde, when this gate
was bulte or Reedified, and it was thus sett downe: Ano
Dom. 1475.</p>

<p>When we had entered this gate, the firste turninge that
we could finde upon our Ryghte hande we turned up a
verrie fine streete to go to the wales. We there founde
myghtie greate ordenance, bothe of brass and Iron, the
which was made by Christians; som great peecis of brass
that weare burste when the Turkes lay seige unto the
towne.</p>

<p>Ther weare marvalus greate peecis that weare made of
hamered Iron, everie stafe<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> at the leaste 3 Inches square,
and houped aboute lyke a barrell, the bore so bige as tow
man myghte creep in bothe at once. A Greeke that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
gided us aboute the Wales tould us that one of these
peecis, beinge once discharged, could not be charged
a gaine, and made Reddie to be discharged, in less than
tow houres.</p>

<p>This towne is Doble waled, betwixte the wales the
distance of a pare of shorte butts (boats), and the ditche is
verrie Depe, but drie.</p>

<p>To be shorte, havinge paste Rounde aboute the towne
with oute any contradicktion or staye, only the time that
we Dranke a pitcher of wyne which coste us but one
penye, we made haste unto the seaye sid, and so to goe
aborde. When we weare with oute the gate, loukinge for
our bote, we se it cominge of from our shipe. When it
cam to the shore, thare was in it Mr. Maye, our preatcher,
and one that was appoynted to be our Imbaseders under
butler. Cothe Mr. Maye to me: Ar you Reddie to goo
aborde? Yeae, truly! said I; for I am verrie hungrie and
wearrie with travell. I praye you, sayde he, go backe
againe with me to the gate, that I maye but se the superscription
over it, and sett one foute within the gate, and
then I will go backe againe with you. So we wente all
backe with Mr. Maye to the gate. When we weare thare,
he saw a farr of a fountaine of water, made lyke one of our
Conducktes, with a fayre, brighte Dishe of steele hanginge
in a cheane, for the Turkes drinke nothinge but water. I
praye you, cothe Mr. Maye, goe with me to yonder fountaine,
that I may drinke som of that water, for it semethe
to be verrie good, and I have a greate desier to drinke som
of it. So we wente all with him to the fountaine, and
everie one of us did drinke a dishe of water. As we weare
a drinkinge, thare came unto us tow stout Turkes, and sayd:
Parlye Francko, sinyore? which is: Can ye speake Ittallian,
sinyor? Soe cothe Mr. Maye. Soe, as theye weare
a talkinge, I louked aboute me, and a Turke, settinge upon
his stale (stall), who did know me—for he had hard me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
play on my virginals and kissed me aborde our shipe—he
beckened me to com unto him; and when I came som
what neare him, in kindnes and som love he bore unto me,
made me a sine to be gone; and poynted to the gate, and
bid me make haste. So to the gate went I as faste as I
coulde Truge, and my mate Harvie and the Reste of my
Company followed after as faste as theye could; leavinge
Mr. Maye and the under butler talkinge with the Turkes,
for theye tow could speake Ittallian a litle, and so could
none of us. When we weare gotten withoute the gate we
Louked backe towardes the fountaine, but we se nobodye
there; for the Turkes had carried Mr. Maye and the other
man to prison. By chance we founde our bote and sayleres
thare Reddie, and aborde our shipe we wente. When we
came aborde, I wente presently to our Mr., and tould him
all that had hapened. When I tould him how I had
bene aboute the towne, he Imagened that we by that
meanes had given som offence; because it is Daingerus for
a stranger, beinge a Christian, to Take a vew of that towne,
and so thoughte that for our faulte these men weare taken
presoners. What wordes did pass betwyxte our Mr. and
me I will omitt till God send us into Inglande. No man
durste be so boulde as to goo ashore all that Daye, nether
did any com abord us.</p>

<p>The nexte morninge a litle Greeke bote cam from the
towne abord our shipe wythe a Letter from Mr. Maye,
Direckted not onlye to our Mr. and marchantes, but also to
the Reste of theyre companye. This Letter was wrytten
so pittifully, as yf theye had bene presoneres thare seven
yeares: showinge how they weare taken from the fountayne
and copled together, lyke as theye hade bene tow Doggs, with
a cheane of could Rustie Iron, and lede into a Darke dungeon,
thare cheane fastened with a staple unto a poste wheare
they muste continually stande, and nether sitt nor knele,
and everye tow houres weare shaken over them whippes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
made of wyere, threatening most Crouell punishmente; and
tharfore desiered that by all meanes thei would seke som
meanes for theyer spedie Release, or eles that theye myghte
be presently put to Deathe, for theye weare not able to
Induer that myserable lyfe and sharp punishment, which
was lykly to be Inflicted vpon them yf the ship did once
departe. Our Mr. and marchantes weare so wounded with
Reding this letter, and pittinge the presoneres case, and
banishinge all feare, they Resolvede to go ashore. Our
Mr. and five martchants havinge made themselves as brave
as they could, they wente a shore verrie stoutly to the
Captayns house, desieringe to speake with the chial, the
Captain bassha his debutie, who after he had made them to
staye whyle he came unto them to know the cose of theire
cominge, one of our men that could beste speak Ittallian
Tould him that Theye founde them selves verrie muche
aggreved that theyer men should be stayede as presoneres,
and not to be Informed of the Cause; and lyke wyse
wondered how they Durste be so bould as to make stay of
any one of our men, we beinge goinge with so Riche a
presente to the Grand Sinyor, and those tow men which
theye had stayed weare tow spetiall men, one of them our
Divine and preacher, the other the chefe and princepall
man for the presente. This, with other wordes, they sayed
to feare them; also theye sayd that yf he would not
presently deliver those men, they would hier a gallie and
send to the Grand Sinyor, that he might understand how
they wear wronged and hindred in their voyege without
any occation given to our knowledge.</p>

<p>The Answer of the Chial was this:</p>

<p>Yeaster Day I was abord your Shipp presentinge my
Captayn’s person in his absence; you gave me not suche
entertainmente as my place Did Requier; you made me no
good cheare, nether Did you give me a presente for my
Captaine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Our men answeared: The beste Entertainmente that
we could give unto yow for the time yow had; good cheare
we could mak yow none, for we had nothinge for our selves;
our cominge to this place was to haue some Relefe heare,
and to furnishe our selves with suche vitals as this contrie
yeldethe for our monye. Whereas yow saye that yow had
no presente for your Captayne, yow say not truly, for yow
had so muche brode Clothe as would make your Captaine
a Veste. But than said the chial: I had none for my selfe,
and one will I have before yow have your men. Then
saide they: Is that all the occation that moved yow to
Impreson our men? And will the gifte of suche a presente
give you contente That we maye have our men?
Yea, surlye, sayde the chia. And so this Quarell was
ended. Heare yow maye se the base and covetus condition
of these Rude and barbarus doged Turkes, and how
litle they do Regard Christians.</p>

<p>This Cittie wale which is nexte unto the seae is marvalus
stronge, and so fortified with greate ordinance, not upon
the wale, but their nosis Do louke throw the wale, so
placed that no ship can pass on that side of the lande
withoute leve. Within the town, in most streetes, a man
cannot trott a horse, the streetes ly so full of bulletes,
made of marble,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and of all sizis, from 16 Incchis to 3
Inchis. Many other Thinges conserninge this Cittie and
Iland I do omit till my Returne into Inglande; but of all
the townes or Citties that in my life I have sene, for
strengthe I never saw the lyke.</p>

<p>Now, havinge Redemed our men oute of prison, the
next day beinge the 30th, or last day of June, we wayed
Anker, hoysed saile, and so to sea.</p>

<p>The firste of July, beinge under saile, we entered the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Aegebu,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> passinge by and emongste the Iles of Archipelagua,
wheare is a marvalus company of little Ilandes. The
second daye we sailed by one of them emongeste the Reste,
leavinge it southe. It is caled Lango.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Upon the northe
side verrie pleasante lowe grounde, wheare semed to be
not only store of vines, but plentie of other frute. Also we
se a verrie fine toune, whose wales Resiste the waves of the
sea. Within the towne verrie fayer buildinges, the which
was never done by the Turkes, thoughe they now Inioye
(enjoy) the same. It was our happ to caste Anker before
the towne alnyghte, but in the morninge we sett sayle.
The towne is called Lango (Stanco), by the name of the
Ilande.</p>

<p>The third daye, standinge upon the spar-decke of our
shipp, I tould no less than 16 Ilandes which weare Rounde
about us.</p>

<p>The fourthe day, leavinge Learo<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> southe, we came to the
Ilande Samose, wheare that famos felosefer Pathagarus was
borne. This Ilande, for the moste parte, is Inhabited with
Greekes. The wynde beinge verrie contrarie to our cource,
that findinge a faire Roode, we Caste anker thare, wheare
we myghte se a litle towne, a myle and better from the
shore.</p>

<p>The people in the towne, seeinge our shipp com to an
anker, we sawe them Rune into the felds and drive awaye
there Cattell with greate speede up into the mountaines.
Also in the Rood, halfe a myle from us, was a litle shipp
or barke, the which they halled ashore, and carriede awaye
the goodes that was in her; but they touke more paynes
then theie needed, for we ment them no harme, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
hour within nyghte we wayed Anker; but the wynd was so
Direcktly in the narrow passage<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> we had to go betwyxt that
Iland and another,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> that we could not pass, but weare forced
to put in againe at the southe easte corner of the same
ilande, under hudge mountaine.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> To my thinkinge it is
only one parme stone (pumice stone), and of sartaintie all
that parte which was nexte unto the sea is a fearme stone,
and verrie streighte uprighte.</p>

<p>The nexte Day som of our men went a shore to se yf
they could find any freshe water, and to cut doune som
fier wood.</p>

<p>One of those men, beinge a verrie bould fellow, stole
away from his fellowes, and wente to the towne aforesayde.
He presumed partly upon his language, but the reste of his
fellowes came aborde without him, and everie one did
thinke that he was taken prisoner. The nexte daye, aboute
ten of the clocke, he came to the sea sid, and weaved for a
boate; so, when he cam aborde, he broughte with him som
hens and som breade, and was halfe Drunke with wyne.
About tow houres after came to the shore the captaine of
that ilande, who was a Turke, and broughte with him a
presente, in hope to recave a better.</p>

<p>Heare doth grow a kinde of graine or corne, which theie
do call myllio (millet), a small seed muche lyke unto
canara-bird seed. The increase of it is at the least one
hundrethe and fiftie foulde. They make of it finer bread
than of wheate. The eighte Daye Died one John Knill,
sarvante to Mr. Wyseman, marchante, who was also one
of the owneres of our shipp.</p>

<p>The tenthe daye we wayed anker, and provede to pass
our cource, but the wynde would not suffer us, beinge weste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and by northe, as it was before. When we saw that we
could not prevaile againste the wynde, we came rounde
to that place whear we did firste anker, thinkinge thare
to git som better store of vitals and freshe water; but beinge
verrie darke before we could git into the harber, by the
necklyience (negligence) of him that sounded, our ship was
a grounde, the which turned us to greate feare and muche
truble a greate parte of that nyghte; yeat in the ende all
was well. But in the morninge, when we did thinke to have
gone a shore, we espied 4 gallis and a frigett, which came
stealinge by the shore. The gallis stayed a league of, under
the shore of Asia the lesse, but the frigett came into the
roode to se what we wear, and thar came to an anker; the
which when our Mr. persaved, not knowinge what There
intent was, he caused anker to be wayed with all speed,
and beinge under saile, the frigett went before us, and also
the gallis; for than our Mr. purposed to goo that way
which before he Durste not adventur; for whearas we
should have lefte this ilande on our Righte hand, now we
lefte it on our lefte hand, and ventured to goo be twyxte
Samose and the mayne land of Asia the less, the which is
a marvalus straite pasege for suche a ship as ours was.
Even in the straighteste place these four gallis stayed for
us, but when they se our strengthe and bouldnes, they
weare afrayed of us. They had placed ther gallis cloce by
the shore, so that ether the beake head did tuche the shore
or else there ors myghte, and yeat had we hardly roume
enoughe to pass betwyxte theire ores and the mayne lande.
Our Mr. caused all our company to stand up and make as
great a show as we coulde, and when we weare ryghte over
againste them, our five trumpetes sounded sodonly, which
made them wonder, loukinge earnestly upon us, but gave
us not a worde; so we Dashte them oute of countinance
who mente to have feared us, and we lefte them by the
shore of Samose, beinge the eleventhe day of July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The 12th daye we discried Scio. The 13th we sayled by
the shore of that ilande.</p>

<p>The 14th we cam to an anker in a rood, tow leagues
shorte of the greate towne or Cittie of Scio, so called by
the name of the ilande.</p>

<p>The 15th day, in the morninge, our longe boate beinge
reddie to go ashore for freshe water, which we stod great
need of, for in 3 dayes before we had nothinge to eate but
rice boyled in stinkinge water, and our bevveredge did
also stincke. The boate beinge lanched, thre of our jentlmen
passingeres came unto me and asked me yf I would
goo a shore to see yf we could buy some freshe vittals,
and I sayd: Yeae, with all my harte. Assowne as we weare
in the boate, the Mr. was tould of it, and he louked over
the ship side, and spoke unto me, for the other myghte
have gone with his good will, and nevere com again, nether
woulde he have stayed halfe an hour for them; but theye
did know that he would not leave me behinde. So the
Mr. asked me whether I would go, and I tould him but to
sett foute on shore, drinke som freshe water, and com
aborde with the boate. Than he bid me come aborde
againe presently, but the jentlmen had me betwyxte them,
and helde me faste; nether did I meane to dow as he bid
me. Well, sayd the Mr., I see ye will goo ashore, and the
companye that is with yow will draw yow up to yonder
towne which you se, and I will tell you before you goo
that which yow shall finde true. In no parte of the worlde
Dothe grow any masticke<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> but in this ilande, and now is
the time for it. The commodities heare ar nothinge but
masticke, cotten woll, and wynes. Yow cannot goo to
yonder towne but yow muste needes go throughe the gardens
wheare these thinges grow; and yf you be sene to
take one sprige of masticke, or one podd of cotten woll, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
one bunche of grapes, it is a whole yeares impresonmente,
and thare wilbe no redemption for you. Tharfore do not
saye but that I gave yow suffitiente warninge, etc.</p>

<p>This iland of Scio is risinge from the sea side som 3 or
4 myle, and this towne which we mente to go unto is tow
myle from the sea, and it semed, a farr off, to be a prittie
towne, with a castell in the mydeste of it.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>When the Mr. had tould us his mynde, for the Daingeres
we myghte fale into unawares, than he sayd to me that yf I
cam not backe againe with the boat when she had taken in
water, he would sett sayle and be gone; but we feared not
that, for as sowne as we came to lande, we wente direcktly
to the towne. It was upon the Sondaye, and the people
seinge our ship com to an anker, and seldum had sene the
lyke in that contrie, and lykwyse saw us com a shore, many
wemen and childrin came to meet us, who wondred as
muche at us as we did at them. We wente on right forwardes,
givinge no bodie one worde till we came into the
mydle of the towne under the castell wale, and thare standinge
still loukinge aboute us, thare came a Greeke unto
us, and demanded whom we soughte for, or whither we
would goo. To of our company could speake Ittalian well,
who Answered that our cominge was to buy som vitals.</p>

<p>This man saide thare was a Consoll in the towne, and we
muste repare unto him before we could have anythinge, so
he wente with us unto the Consols house. The streetes weare
full of people, which flocked together to louke upon us.</p>

<p>When we came to the Consols house, we weare to go up
a pare of staires, made lyke a ladder at one end of the
house withoute. This lader went up to a stage or scaffould
which was on the backesid of his house, that louked righte
towardes the sea wheare our shipp lay at an anker. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
consoll was apon this stage, sittinge at a table, and with him
thare was six verrie gallant jentlwemen, and verrie beautifull.
Assowne as we came up, these brave wemen arose and
wente awaye, and the Consoll came unto us, imbracinge
us one after another, and bid us verrie wellcom. He caused
the Table to be furnished with a verrie fine bankett (banquet)
of sweete meates, and but tow litle cakes of breade;
our drinke was verrie good raspis.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Whyleste we satt thare
talkinge, the common sorte of the people in that towne
came to the garden wales, for on that sid of the house was
the Consols garthen, and the wales weare of stone withoute
morter, and the people Did so muche desier to se us, that
they did climbe upon the wales. The Consoll many times
stood up chidinge them, and shakinge his hande at them,
threatininge punishmente; but the more he chid, the more
the people did climbe upon the wale, and the wale beinge
over loden, Downe came the wale, makinge a greate noyes,
the lengthe of a pare of butes (boats), and almoste so
muche in another place. The which made The Consoll
verrie angrie, and he myghte verrie well have wyshte that
we had note com thare.</p>

<p>Wheare we satt we myghte se our shipp ryghte before
us, and we se the boate goo a bord with water.</p>

<p>In this meane time, the Consoll had sente tow men
aboute the towne, to se what vitels they could git for us; at
the end of tow houres theye came againe, and tould us that
theye could find nothinge that was to be sould at that time,
beinge Sondaye, but aboute a bushell of garlicke, the which
we wear contented to take, because we would have somthinge;
and we saw that we weare trublsom to the Consoll;
so, havinge taken or leves of the Consoll, he apoynted one
to carrie our garlick to the townes end before us. Goinge
Downe the ladder from the scaffould, upon bothe sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the ladder did stand the chefeste wemen in the towne, in
degrees one above Another, to se us at our goinge awaye;
they stoode in suche order as we myghte se theire facis and
bristes nakede, yeat weare they verrie richly appareled, with
cheanes aboute theyre neckes, and juels in them and in
there eares, theire heades verrie comly dresed with rebbininge
of diverse collores; but that which made us moste
admiere them was their beautie and cleare complecktion.
I thinke that no parte of the worlde can compare with the
wemen in That contrie for beautie; but afterwards we
understood that yf we had gone to the Cittie, which was
but sixe myles further, we should have bene muche better
entertained, for in that Cittie was an Inglishe Consoll,
whose name was Mr. Willyam Aldridge, a fine jentlman,
but our Mr. would not put in thare, for feare of beinge put
to som charge; for he was a verrie myserable and sparinge
man, all for his owne profitt, and not regardinge to satisfie
other mens Desieres, or to give his passingers anye
Contente.</p>

<p>Beinge Come aborde our ship with our bage of garelicke,
it was not so selenderly regarded but that we myghte have
had chapmen (buyers) for it, and our monye againe with
profitt.</p>

<p>The same Daye Anker was wayed, and we under sail,
but we profetted litle, for before the morninge we came to
an Anker againe somethinge neare to the same place.</p>

<p>The nexte daye, beinge the 16 daye, we wayed Anker
againe, and weare becalmed before the greate toone of
Scio, verrie neare unto it, but our Mr. would not suffer any
man to goo ashore.</p>

<p>The 19th of July we came to the Iland Tenedoes, the
which is ryghte over agenste the southe Ende of the platt
or ruins of the great Cittie of Troye, the wynde beinge
Direcktly againste us, and also a great Currante which
comes from the rever of Hellisponte. We came to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Anker by the Shore, neare to that southe gatte of Troye;
a greate parte of the gate is yeat standinge, with som
hudge peecis of those myghtie wales that hathe bene.</p>

<p>The xxth Daye we wayed Anker againe, but could do
no goode, for the wynde and currante was againste us, and
we came to an anker againe neare to the same place.</p>

<p>The 21 Day, Died a boye Caled John Felton, who was
borne at Yarmouthe.</p>

<p>Also, the same day, I and som more of our company
wente a shore, and sawe som monimentes in Troy, peecis
of wales, sutchins,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and marble pillares.</p>

<p>We beinge come aborde againe, ii of the greate Turkes
gallis cam by us, some rowinge and som saylinge; bucause
they should not com a borde us, our Mr. caused Anker to
be wayed, and towardes nyghte, the wynde faylinge, we
came to an anker againe.</p>

<p>The 22th Day, tow friggotes which came down the ryver
Hellisponte, seinge our ship, and knowing her to be a ship
from Inglande by her flage in the mayn top, tow Inglishe
men that weare in one of the friggotes desiered of ther
Captaine that they myghte haile our shipe. The captaine
was verrie willinge so to dow, The which our captaine, or
Mr., persavinge, and knowing the frigotes to be Turkes,
and because theye should not come a borde us, he caused
Anker to be wayed with all speede; for the Turk’s condition
is suche that, yf they come a borde, the captaines
would have had a presente, or have beged somthinge.</p>

<p>So by that time that theye weare com unto us, we weare
under saille. Than the tow Inglishe men caled unto us,
and, after som salutations, theye tould our Mr. thate thare
was cominge at hande The Amberall of the greate Turkes
navie, and, in his Company, 15 gallis more; and also
showed how we myghte knowe the Amberall from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the reste, for his gallie had tow lanthorns on his poupe,
and the reste but one a peece. And so these friggotes
departede.</p>

<p>No souner weare the frigotes gone but we discried the
gallies verrie neare unto us, for theye cam downe the
rever Hellisponte, at a corner by the wales of Troye. The
sighte of these gallis, to our thinkinge, was a marvalus
show, they weare so curiusly paynted with fayre collors
and good varnishe. The slaves that weare in them rowinge
satt all nakede. As they weare rowinge towardes
Tenedoes, the wynde cam fayer for them, and than they
cut ther sayels, and the slaves weare covered with a peece
of canves that over sprede them all. When the gallis
weare under saile they showed muche better than theye
did before. The sailes weare made of cotten woll, and one
clothe verrie whyte, and another verrie blewe, and the
masts of the sam colores.</p>

<p>As theye weare sailinge by us, our Mr. caused the gonors
to give them thre peecis, the which was but meserably
done; yeate, beinge so neare the wales of Troy, the eckco
was suche that everie peece semed to be five by the reporte.</p>

<p>Than the Amberall sente a gallie unto us to demande
his presente, and also to aske whye we did salute him no
better. The gallie beinge com unto us with his messege,
our Mr. answered that the Amberal’s presente was caked<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
under the hatchis, nether did he know what it was untill
he came to our imbassador at Constantinople; and for
that thare was no better salutation, or more shott given to
the Amberall, the reason was That he did [not] knowe
that the Amberall was thare. Yf he hade he would have
given him all the ordinance in our shipp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>This excuse beinge made, the captaine of that gallie, who
did not com a borde us, but sente a litle boate to our ship
sid, for the gallie durste not com neare us, but the men in
this boate sad that their captaine myghte not returne
to his amberall excepte he carried him som smale presente.</p>

<p>Than our Mr., makinge deligente seartche in our ship,
he found tow holland chestis, the which he sente to the
amberall. Than the captaine of that gallie demanded a
presente for him selfe. Our Mr. answered that he had
nothinge. Than he desiered to have som tobacko<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and
tobackco-pipes, the which in the end he had. And so he
sailed to Tenedose, wheare the Amberall and the reste of
the gallis weare come to an Anker. At his departur, our
Mr. gave him one peece with the shott.</p>

<p>Aboute tow houres after this gallie was gone, the wynde
beinge verrie smale, and touke us shorte righte befor Cape
Jenisarie, by som people caled the Cape of Janisaries.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Thare I wente a shore wythe som of our martchantes,
wheare we founde a litle scateringe villidge, inhabited with
Greekes. Thare we boughte som breade and hens.</p>

<p>Also thare we saw more at large the rewins of the wales
and housis in Troye, and from thence I broughte a peece
of a whyte marble piller, the which I broke with my owne
handes, havinge a good hamer, which my mate Harvie did
carrie a shore for the same purpose; and I broughte this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
peece of marble to London. This Cape Jenisarie is aboute
ten myle from Tenedose.</p>

<p>Now, beinge Come aborde our ship, we sett saile the
same Daye, and entered into the rever Hellisponte seven
leagues, and thare came to an Anker neare unto the tow
Castels caled Sestose and Abidose. Sestose is in Thracia,
and Abidose in Litle Asia. These tow Castels are verrie
strongly kepte for the defence of entringe the Straites of
Hellisponte aforesaid, which is the waye that all shipinge
muste pass by that goethe to Constantinople.</p>

<p>The 24 a Captaine of one of the Castels came aborde our
shipp, and broughte with him a presente.</p>

<p>Diverse other Turkishe captains came a borde us in the
time that we stayed thare, and also the Consoll of Gallippelo.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Beinge thare by chance he came a borde us.
This Consoll is a frier, and verrie fine Jentlman.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Auguste.</span></h4>

<p>In the time that we stayed heare for a wynde, we wente
many times a shore, but what hapened, and what we saw
at this time, I pass over.</p>

<p>But our Imbasador who was than at Constantinople,
hearinge that our shipp had layne longe thare for a wynde,
he sente downe a Chirmagee<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> to fetche up sartaine letters,
and also for us that weare for the present; in the Chirmagee
came Mr. Thomas Glover,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Mr. Baylye of Saulsburie, and
a Jenisarie. From Constantinople to that place is neare
aboute tow hundrethe and fiftie myle.</p>

<p>The nexte morninge, being the fifte of Aguste, not only
we that weare for the presente, butt also Mr. Maye, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
preatcher, and other Jentlmen that wente to sarve the
Imbassader, would needes leave the shipe and goo with
us, for it was thoughte by our fizitions that one of our
sailores was infeckted with the plague.</p>

<p>The Chirmagee would not carrie us all, but Mr. Glover
did hier tow boates more. We weare, in all, 16, with Mr.
Glover and Mr. Baylye.</p>

<p>The sixte Daye we arived at Gallipilo, and cominge to
the Ittallian Consol’s house, who is a frier, he recaved us
verrie kindly, but our staye was so shorte that we had no
time to se the Cittie. Haveing fayer wynde, we made
haste to sea againe. Aboute the mydle of the nyghte followinge,
haveinge no wynde at all, and our men wearie
with rowinge, we wente a shore, wheare we founde 3 or 4
wynde myls and the wales of an ould Castele. Though it
was verrie Darke, yeat some of our men rowed up and
downe till theye founde a litle cottage, wheare they gott
some fiere. Others broke downe an ould hedge; and so
we made a greate fier under the Castle wale. At Gallipilo,
the daye before, at our goinge to sea, we boughte halfe a
mutton, and heare we boyled the one halfe, and rosted
the other. Thoughe it was but in a homly fashon, yeat we
eat it bothe merrily and sweetly. Our fier was so large
that we hade hyghte (heat) enoughe.</p>

<p>Before the morninge we wente to sea againe. When it
was Daye, the wynde rose so greate that we weare forced
to goo a shore, and to hale our boates on lande at a greate
Towne Called Relezea.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Thare we founde wyne and
breade greate plentie, but some of our Company did
wake into the feeldes, and entered into a vinyarde to
gather grapes; but beinge pursued by the Greekes that
owed the vinyard, they weare not only in Dainger of recavinge
som hurte, but also of lousing theire garmentes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Cuthberte Bull had loste his Cloake, and one that wente to
be the Imbassaderes Couke was pinyonede, his girdle and
knyfes taken awaye; but one Mr. Gonzale, a verrie stoute
man, redemed those thinges againe, and made the Greeks
rune awaye, for he beate them wythe their owne weapons,
but not in theire owne grounde. Than the pore Greeks
made a greate complainte unto the governor of the towne,
whoe was than in our company, and had broughte us a
sheepe for a presente. He quickly made us all frendes,
and Mr. Glover was verrie willinge to make the Greekes
restetution for the hurte was Done them. This governor,
or Captaine of this towne, is a verrie stoute and stronge
man of his person, but actevitie he hade none, for som in
our company did prove him many wayes: he could
nether run, leape, wrastell, pitche the barr, the stone
upon the hande, trowe the sledge,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> nether any defence with
sorde or cudgell; but yf he did catche a man in his armes
fadem wyse,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> he would so crushe him, that he would make
his harte ake, and reddie to stop his brethe. He beinge
askede the reason whye he could do none of these exercisis,
he Answered that Turkes would never pracktise the same
that Christians did. At this toune we stayed alnyghte.
The nexte morninge, our captaine, Mr. Glover, gave unto
this governor or captaine, 2 or 3 peecis of goold caled
chickenes,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> for his love and good company, for he was verrie
willinge to make us merry and lothe that we should
departe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The same daye, beinge the eighte daye, we touke our
jurnaye by lande, towinge our bootes by the shore ten
myles.</p>

<p>In the after nowne we came to a towne called Hora,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> for
our boates was not able to goo any further, the wynde was
so hie and the sea so roughe; thare we stayed alnyghte.
At this towne, but espetialy at the laste before, is great
store of corne and vinyardes, verrie good; also greate store
of silke wormes, wyne a pottell<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> for one penye; but the
inhabytans of all these townes ar verrie pore, the Turks
dothe kepe them so under, levinge upon the frutes of these
pore peoples labures. All this contrie which we traveled
through from over againste Troye, or the place wheare we
lefte our shipp, is Thratia, whearin Constantinople doth
stande.</p>

<p>The nexte daye, beinge the nynthe daye, we lefte our
boates at Horra, and wente 3 myles farther to a towne
caled Cannosea,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> but farther we could not goo anythinge
neare to the sea, for it is so hillie and full of woodes, a
verrie wyldernes; so thare we stayed that daye and
alnyghte ever loukinge for our boates, but they could not
com. Our captaine, Mr. Glover, when we had well vewed
the towne and se that the condetion of the people was
not to our lykinge, he made choyce of a house for us
to lodge in, that was next unto the sea. The towne stode
upon a hill, and this house upon the verrie brinke or end of
the hill, beinge the heighte of St. Paules Churche a bove
the sea; and we weare to go up a ladder into a gallarie,
that was made at the end of the house, loukinge towardes
the sea, and thare was a litle dowre to go into the roume
wheare we shoulde lodge upon the bare bordes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>For, in all this time that we traveled, we never put of our
clothis, nether did we finde any beed to rest in. In this
roume thare was not so muche as a stoule or forme to sitt
upon, nor anythinge in the house but one shelfe, whereon
stood tow pitcheres and tow earthen plateres; note one
wyndoe to give lyghte, but one litle hole throughe a stone
wale.</p>

<p>We beinge at this towne before nowne, to pass awaye the
time after we had made a shorte diner, we walked downe to
the wood sid, which is close to the sea; a wildernes or
desarte wood, which is put to no use, as we did thinke, by
the sighte of it. Thare we saw diverse sortes of varmen,
which we have not the like in Inglande.</p>

<p>Growinge towardes nyghte, and rememberinge whate
hard lodginge we should have in our new In, findinge a
thicke softe weed, that growed by the wood sid, everrie one
of us that was thare gathered a bundle of it to laye under
our heades, when we should sleepe.</p>

<p>Nyghte beinge come, and our supper ended, everie man
chalked out his ristinge place upon the bare bordes; our
jenisarie placed him selfe upon a borde that laye louse
upon the joistes. Everie man had his Sorde reddie Drawne
lyinge by his side; tow of our company had musketes.
When we had layne about halfe an houre, we that had our
weeden pillowes weare sodonly wonderfully tormented with
a varmen that was in our pillowes, the which did bite farr
worss than fleaes, so that we weare glad to throw awaye
our pillowes, and swepe the house cleane; but we could not
clense our selves so sowne. Thus as we laye wakinge in a
Darke uncomfortable house, Mr. Glover tould us what
strainge varmen and beastes he had sene in that contrie, for
he had lived longe thare. He spoake verrie muche of
Aderes, snaykes, and sarpentes, the defferance and the
bignes of som which he had sene.</p>

<p>Passinge awaye the time with such lyke talke, the moste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
parte of us fell a sleepe, and som that could not sleepe laye
still and sayd nothinge for disquietinge of the reste, all
beinge whyshte. Mr. Baylye had occasion to goe to the
dore to make water, the dore was verrie litle, and opened
very straitly into the gallarie, the wynde blowed marvalus
strongly, and made a greate noyse, for the house
lay verrie open to the sea and wether. Mr. Baylle, when
he lay downe to sleepe, had untied his garters a litle, so
that when he came into the gallarie, the wynde blew his
garter, that was louse and trayled after him, rounde aboute
the other legge; it was a greate silke garter, and by the
force of the wynde it fettered his legges bothe faste together.
Our talk a litle before, of Aders, snakes, and
sarpentes, was yeat in his rememberance, and the place was
neare wheare muche varmen was. He thoughte they had
swarmed aboute him, but aboute his legges he Thought he
was sur of a sarpente, so that soddonly he cried oute with all
the voyce he hade: A sarpente! a sarpente! a sarpente! and
was so frighted that he could not finde the doore to gitt in,
but made a great buslinge and noyse in the gallarie. On the
other side, we that weare in the house, did thinke that he
had saide: Assalted! assalted! for before nyghte we
doubted that some tritcherie would hapen unto us in that
towne, so that we thoughte the house had bene besett with
people to cutt our Throtes. Thare was 15 of us in the
house, and it was bute a litle house; everie man touke his
sorde in hande, one reddie to spoyle another, not any one
knowinge the Cause. One that could not finde his sorde,
goot to the Chimnay, and offeringe to climbe up, Downe
fell a parte of the chimnaye tope upon his heade, and hurte
him a litle; another, that was sodonly awakede, strouke
aboute him with his sorde, and beate downe the shelfe and
broke the pitcheres and plateres which stood thar on; the
roume being verrie darke, for it was a boute mydnyghte.
Otheres did thinke that they weare pullinge downe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
house over our heades. Our janisarie, who should have
bene our garde, and have protecked us from all Daingeres,
he lykwyse doubtinge the people of the towne, and hearinge
suche a noyse sodonly, he touke up the louse borde
wheare on he laye, and sliped Downe into the valte.
As we weare thus all amayzed, at the laste Mr. Bayllye
founde the waye in at the doore. When Mr. Glover saw
him com in, he sayd unto him: How now, man, what is the
matter, who do you se? Mr. Baylle was even bretheless
with feare, cryinge out, and with struglinge to gitt in at the
doore, so thet he could not answer him at the firste; at last
he sayd: A sarpente! a sarpente! had trubled him. When
Mr. Glover harde him say so, than feare was gone, and he
wente to the Dore, and thare he founde Mr. Bayllis’ garter
reddie to be carried away with the wynde. After we a
litle wondered at our greate amayzmente for so smale a
cause, Mr. Glover caled everie man by his name, to se yf
any man weare slayne or wounded; for thare was sixtene
of us in all, our weaperns all drawne, and the roume was but
litle. Everie man beinge caled, we weare all alive, and but
smale hurtes done. At laste we founde our janisarie wanting;
who myghte well be ashamed to make it knowne
wheare he was; but Mr. Glover callinge him verrie earnestly,
he answered in the valte. He could not git out any way,
but Mr. Gonzale Touke up the borde that laye wheare he
wente downe, and lyinge a longe upon the floure, he could
but hardly reatche him, to take him by the hande; without
muche adew theye puled him up. When he leaped into the
valte, beinge verrie sore frighted, he caste of his uper
garmente, and lefte it behind him in the valte, but no man
could perswade him to goo downe againe and fetche it, for
the place was lothesom, and it should seme that he was
thare frighted with somthinge, in that kinde Mr. Baylye
was; so his garmente remayned there till the morninge,
that he who oned the house did fetche it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The nexte morninge, Mr. Sharpe, Mr. Lamberte, and tow
jentlmen more, hiered mules, and touke theire jurnaye by
lande to Stambole, or Constantinople, the which was 3
dayes jurnaye.</p>

<p>The same Daye, when these 4 jentlmen weare gone, we
returnede to Hora againe, wheare we lefte our boates,
and stayed thare alnyghte.</p>

<p>In the morninge we departede, and in the afternowne we
wente ashore at a towne caled Heragleza,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> other wyse
Rellinge. Betwyxte this towne and the sea, upon a hill
Dothe stande tow and twentie fayer wynde milns; everie
milne hathe six sayles. They stande upon a straighte lyne,
and of an equalle distance, so as theye made a verrie fayer
shaw when we weare upon the seae. We weare at this
towne verrie Curtiusly entertained, wheare we made merrie
till mydnyghte, than Entringe our boates. In the morninge,
beinge the 14th Day, we came to Selabrea,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> a faire and
large towne. We wente thare a shore for wyne and water,
but we stayed not so longe as to se all the towne. Heare I
se greate abundance of moske mylyons,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that weare as big
as our sidrums or pumpions,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> sould for the vallue of one
penye or 3 halfe penis a peece.</p>

<p>The 15th day, beinge Wednesday, we arived at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The 16th our shipp Came neare to the Seven Towers,
which is the firste porte that we com unto of the surralia
(seraglio) which doth joyne close to the Cittie. From that
poynte or corner of the surralia unto the Cittie it is almoste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
tow myles; thare our shipp cam to an anker, and the nexte
daye she begane to be new payntede.</p>

<p>The 17th we wente aborde our ship for the presente,
and carried it to our imbassaders house in the Cittie of
Gallata, in the vines<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> of Peara<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>; and because there was no
roome heie enoughe to sett it up in his house, he caused
a roome to be made with all speed withoute the house in
the courte, to sett it up in, that it myghte there be made
perfitt before it should be carried to the surralia.</p>

<p>The twentethe daye, beinge Mondaye, we begane to
louke into our worke; but when we opened our chistes we
founde that all glewinge worke was clene Decayed, by
reason that it hade layne above sixe monthes in the
hould of our ship, whicte was but newly bulte, so that the
extremetie of the heete in the hould of the shipe, with the
workinge of the sea and the hootnes of the cuntrie, was
the cause that all glewinge fayled; lyke wyse divers of my
mettle pipes weare brused and broken.</p>

<p>When our Imbassader, Mr. Wyllyam Aldridge, and
other jentlmen, se in what case it was in, theye weare all
amayzed, and sayde that it was not worthe ii<i>d</i>. My
answeare unto our Imbassader and to Mr. Aldridge, at
this time I will omitt; but when Mr. Alderidge harde
what I sayede, he tould me that yf I did make it perfitt
he would give me, of his owne purss, 15<i>li.</i>, so aboute my
worke I wente.</p>

<p>The 23, the kinge of Ffess<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> cam to se my worke, and he
satt by me halfe a daye.</p>

<p>The 27, our ship cam nearer unto the surralia. The same
daye the kinge of Fess came againe to se our worke.</p>

<p>The 28, the Heckter, our ship, made hire salutation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the Great Turke, thare called the Grande Sinyor, on the
northe side of the Surralya, the Grande Sinyor beinge
in his Cuske (kiosk), upon the wale which is close to the
sea.</p>

<p>This salutation was verrie strange and wonderfull in the
sighte of the Great Turke and all other Turkes. She was,
as I have saide before, new paynted (upon everie topp an
anshante,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> viz., mayne top, fore top, myssen top, sprid saile
top, and at everie yardes arme a silke penante). All her
braurie<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> I cannot now relate; her faightes<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> was oute, and in
everie top as many men, with their musketes, as coulde
stande conveniently to descharge them.</p>

<p>Anker was wayed, the Daye verrie calme and fayere.
Althinges beinge reddie, our gonores gave fiere, and discharged
eighte score great shotte, and betwyxte everie
greate shott a vallie of smale shott; it was done with
verrie good decorume and true time, and it myghte well
desarve commendations.</p>

<p>But one thinge I noteed, which perswaded my simple
consaite that this great triumpte and charge was verrie
evile bestowed, beinge done unto an infidell. Thare was
one man sicke in the ship, who was the ship carpinder, and
wyth the reporte of the firste greate peece that was discharged
he died.</p>

<p>Lyke wyse at the verrie end of this sarvis an other man,
who was one of the stouteste saileres in the shipp, and all
this whyle had plyed a great peece in the beake heade of
the shipe, as he was raminge in his cartridge of pouder,
som fier being lefte in the bretche of the peece, the pouder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
touke fire and blew that man quite awaye in the smoke;
aboute 3 dayes after all his lower parte, from his waste
downward, was founde tow myle from that place, and his
heade in an other place. When all was done the Grande
Sinyore sent tow men abord our shippe to se how many
greate peecis thare was, for he thoughte there hade bene
four score, and there was but 27.</p>

<p>The 30th daye my worke was finished, and made perfitt
at the imbassaderes house.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">September.</span></h4>

<p>The seconde day, the Grand Sinyor desieringe to take a
better vewe of our shipp, he came in his goulden kieke
(caïque) upon the watter, and wente round a boute the
shipp; but he came so sodonly that his beinge there was
not knowne till 2 or 3 houres after.</p>

<p>One houre after him came the Sultana his mother, in
the lyke maner.</p>

<p>The thirde Day, our imbassader Delivered a presente to
the Vizeare Basha at his house.</p>

<p>The 4 day the Grande Sinyores secritarie, caled the
Cappagaw,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> came to se our instrament.</p>

<p>The 7th day the Gebustaniebashaw<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> came to se;
lykwyse also the Heade Patriarke was expeckted, but he
came not, because som Turkes dined with my lord that
daye.</p>

<p>The 8 day, beinge Satterday, we began to take Downe
our instramente, for that day the Grand Sinyor went from
the surralia som six myles by water to an other surralia
wheare the sultana his mother dothe live; for one monthe
in the yeare it is tolerable for him to goo to that place,
ether in Auguste or in September; at any other time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
may not goo so farr from his owne Surralia, excepte he be
garded with a hunreth thousande men.</p>

<p>The 11th Daye, beinge Tusdaye, we Carried our instramente
over the water to the Grand Sinyors Courte, Called
the surralya, and thare in his moste statlyeste house I began
to sett it up. This watere which we crosed from Galletta
to Surralia is a streame that comethe from the Blacke Sea,
and is called Hellisponte, which partethe Asia and Thratia,
and as it comethe Downe by Galletta, a creke of that rever<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
goethe up into the contrie aboute sixe myles, which
partethe the tow Cittis of Constantinople and Galletta;
they maye go betwyxte them by lande, but it is 12 myle,
and to cross the water it is but one myle. At everie gate
of the surralia thare alwayes sitethe a stoute Turke, abute
the calinge or degre of a justis of the peace, who is caled a
chia; not withstandinge, the gates ar faste shut, for thare
pasethe none in or oute at ther owne pleasures.</p>

<p>Beinge entered within the firste gate, thare was placed
righte againste the gate five greate peecis of brass, with
Christians armes upon them.... Than we passed throughe
verrie Delitfull walkes and garthins; the walkes ar, as it
weare, hedged in with statly siprus tres, planted with an
equale Distance one from thother, betwyxte them and
behinde them, smaler tres that bearethe excelente frute; I
thinke thare is none wanting that is good. The garthenes
I will omite to wryte of at this time. The waye from the
firste gate to the seconde wale is som thinge risinge up a
hill, betwyxte wales aboute a quarter of a myle and better.
The gats of the second wale was also shutt, but when we
came to the gate, my Intarpreter caled to those that kepte
it within. Thoughe they had Knowledge of our cominge,
yeat would they not open the gates untill we had caled and
tould them our busines. These gates ar made all of massie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
iron; tow men, whom they do cale jemeglans,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> did open
them.</p>

<p>Wythein the firste wales ar no housis but one, and that is
the bustanjebasha his house, who is captaine of a thousande
jemeglanes, which doo nothinge but kepe the garthens in
good order; and I am perswaded that thare is none so
well kepte in the worlde. Within the seconde wales tharis
no gardens, but statly buildinges; many courtes paved with
marble and suche lyke stone. Everie ode<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> or by corner
hath som exelente frute tre or tres growing in them; allso
thar is greate abundance of sweete grapes, and of diveres
sortes; thar a man may gather grapes everie Daye in the
yeare. In November, as I satt at diner, I se them gather
grapes upon the vines, and theye broughte them to me to
eate. For the space of a monthe I Dined everie day in the
Surralia, and we had everie day grapes after our meate; but
moste sartain it is that grapes do grow thare contenually.</p>

<p>Cominge into the house whear I was appoynted to sett
up the presente or instramente; it semed to be rether a
churche than a dwellinge house; to say the truthe, it was no
dwellinge house, but a house of pleasur, and lyke wyse a
house of slaughter; for in that house was bulte one litle
house, verrie curius bothe within and witheout; for carvinge,
gildinge, good Collors and vernishe, I have not sene the
lyke.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In this litle house, that emperor that rained when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
was thare, had nyntene brotheres put to deathe in it, and
it was bulte for no other use but for the stranglinge of
everie emperors bretherin.</p>

<p>This great house it selfe hathe in it tow rankes of marble
pillors; the pettestales (pedestals) of them ar made of brass,
and double gilte. The wales on 3 sides of the house ar
waled but halfe waye to the eaves; the other halfe is open;
but yf any storme or great wynde should hapen, they can
sodonly Let fale suche hanginges made of cotten wolle for
that purpose as will kepe out all kindes of wethere, and
sudenly they can open them againe. The fourthe side of
the house, which is close and joynethe unto another house,
the wale is made of purfeare (porphyry), or suche kinde of
stone as when a man walketh by it he maye se him selfe
tharin. Upon the grounde, not only in this house, but all
other that I se in the Surraliae, we treade upon ritch silke
garpites, one of them as muche as four or sixe men can
carrie. Thare weare in this house nether stouls, tables, or
formes, only one coutche of estate. Thare is one side of it
a fishe ponde, that is full of fishe that be of divers collores.</p>

<p>The same Daye, our Imbassader sente Mr. Paule Pinder,
who was then his secritarie, with a presente to the Sultana,
she being at hir garthen. The presente was a Coatche of
six hundrethe poundes vallue.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> At that time the Sultana
did Take greate lykinge to Mr. Pinder, and after wardes
she sente for him to have his private companye, but there
meetinge was croste.</p>

<p>The 15th, I finished my worke in the Surraliao, and I wente<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
once everie daye to se it, and dinede Thare almoste everie
Daye for the space of a monthe; which no Christian ever
did in there memorie that wente awaye a Christian.</p>

<p>The 18 daye (stayinge somthinge longe before I wente),
the Coppagawe (Capougee) who is the Grand Sinyor’s
secritarie, sente for me that one of his frendes myghte heare
the instramente. Before I wente awaye, the tow jemaglanes,
who is keepers of that house, touke me in theire
armes and Kised me, and used many perswations to have
me staye with the Grand Sinyor, and sarve him.</p>

<p>The 21, at nyghte, it was a wonder to se what abundance
of lampes thare was burninge rounde aboute all the
Toweres of the Churchis, bothe in Constantinople and
Galleta.</p>

<p>When we demanded the cause, they tould us that as that
nyghte Mahamet, theire Messies, was borne.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The 24, at nyghte our ambassodor Caled me into his
Chamber and gave me a greate Charge to goo the next
morninge betimes to the surralia and make the instrumente
as perfitt as possibly I could, for that daye, before
noune, the Grand Sinyor would se it, and he was to
Deliver his imbassage to the Grand Sinyor; after he hade
given me that charge he toulde me that he had but done
his dutie in tellinge me of my dutie, and cothe he: Because
yow shall not take this unkindly, I will tell you all and
what you shall truste unto.</p>

<p>The Imbassadores spetche unto me in Love after he
had given me my charge:—</p>

<p>Yow ar come hether wythe a presente from our gratious
Quene, not to an ordinarie prince or kinge, but to a
myghtie monarke of the worlde, but better had it bene
for yow yf it had bene sente to any Christian prince,
for then should yow have bene sure to have receaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
for yor paines a greate rewarde; but yow muste consider
what he is unto whom yow have broughte this
ritche presente, a monarke but an infidell, and the
grande Enymye to all Christians. Whate we or any
other Christians can bringe unto him he dothe thinke
that we dow it in dutie or in feare of him, or in
hoppe of som greate favoure we expeckte at his handes.
It was never knowne that upon the receaving of any
presente he gave any rewarde unto any Christian, and
tharfore yow muste louke for nothinge at his handes. Yow
would thinke that for yor longe and wearriesom voyege,
with dainger of lyfe, that yow weare worthie to have a
litle sighte of him; but that yow muste not loake for
nether; for yow se wheat greate preparinge we made and
have bene aboute ever sense your cominge, for the credite
of our contrie, and for a Deliveringe of this presente and
my imbassadge, the which, by Godes helpe, to-morrow
muste be performede. We cale it kisinge of the Grand
Sinyor’s hande; bute when I com to his gates I shalbe
taken of my horse and seartcht, and lede betwyxte tow
men holdinge my handes downe close to my sides, and so
lede into the presence of the Grand Sinyor, and I muste
kiss his kne or his hanginge sleve. Havinge deliverede
my letteres unto the Coppagawe, I shalbe presently ledd
awaye, goinge backwardes as longe as I can se him, and in
payne of my heade I muste not turne my backe upon him,
and therefore yow muste not louke to have a sighte of
him. I thoughte good to tell yow this, because yow shall
not heareafter blame me, or say that I myghte haue tould
yow so muche; lett not your worke be anythinge the more
carlesly louked unto, and at your cominge home our
martchantes shall give yow thankes, yf it give the Grand
Sinyor contente this one daye. I car not yf it be non after
the nexte, yf it doo not please him at the firste sighte, and
performe not those thinges which it is Toulde him that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
can Dow, he will cause it to be puled downe that he may
trample it under his feete. And than shall we have no
sute grantede, but all our charge will be loste.</p>

<p>After I had given my Lorde thankes for this frindly
spetche, thoughe smale comforte in it, I tould him that
thus muche I understoode by our martchantes before my
cominge oute of London, and that he needed not to Doubte
that thare should be any faulte ether in me or my worke,
for he hade sene the triall of my care and skill in makinge
that perfickte and good which was thoughte to be uncurable,
and in somthinges better than it was when Her
Maiestie sawe it in the banketinge house at Whyte
Hale.</p>

<p>The nexte morninge, being the 25, I wente to the
Surralia, and with me my mate Harvie, who was the
ingener, Mr. Rowland Buckett the paynter, and Myghell
Watson the joyner.</p>

<p>Aboute an houre or tow after my lorde was reddie, and
sett forwarde towardes the surralya, he did ride lyke unto
a kinge, onlye that he wanted a crowne.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Thare roode with
him 22 jentlmen and martchantes, all in clothe of goulde;
ye jentlemen weare these: Mr. Humfrye Cunisbye, Mr.
Baylie of Salsburie, Mr. Paule Pinder,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Mr. Wyllyam
Alderidg, Mr. Jonas Aldridge, and Mr. Thomas Glover.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
The other six weare martchantes; these did ride in vestes
of clothe of goulde, made after the cuntrie fation; thare
wente on foute 28 more in blew gounes made after the
Turkie fation, and everie man a silke grogren<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> cape, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the Ittallian fation. My Livery was a faire clooke of a
Franche greene, etc.</p>

<p>Now when I had sett all my worke in good order, the
jemyglanes which kepte that house espied the Grand
Sinyor cominge upon the water in his goulden Chieke
(caïque), or boate, for he cam that morning six myles by
water; whear I stoode I saw when he sett foote on the
shore.</p>

<p>Than the jemyglanes tould me that I muste avoyd the
house, for the Grand Sinyor would be thare presently. It
was almoste halfe a myle betwyxte the water and that
house; but the Grand Sinyor, haveinge a desier to se his
presente, came thether wythe marvalus greate speed. I
and my company that was with me, beinge put forthe, and
the Dore locked after us, I hard another Dore open, and
upon a sodon a wonderfull noyes of people; for a litle
space it should seme that at the Grand Sinyore’s coming
into the house the dore which I hard opene did sett at
libertie four hundrethe persons which weare locked up
all the time of the Grand Sinyore’s absence, and juste
at his cominge in theye weare sett at libertie, and at the
firste sighte of the presente, with greate admyration did
make a wonderinge noyes.</p>

<p>The Grand Sinyor, beinge seated in his Chaire of estate,
commanded silence. All being quiett, and no noyes at all,
the presente began to salute the Grand Sinyor; for when
I lefte it I did alow a quarter of an houre for his cominge
thether. Firste the clocke strouke 22; than The chime
of 16 bels went of, and played a songe of 4 partes. That
beinge done, tow personagis which stood upon to corners
of the seconde storie, houldinge tow silver trumpetes in
there handes, did lifte them to theire heades, and sounded
a tantarra.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Than the muzicke went of, and the orgon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
played a song of 5 partes twyse over. In the tope of the
orgon, being 16 foute hie, did stande a holly bushe full of
blacke birds and thrushis, which at the end of the musick
did singe and shake theire wynges. Divers other motions
thare was which the Grand Sinyor wondered at. Than the
Grand Sinyor asked the Coppagawe<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> yf it would ever doo the
lyke againe. He answered that it would doo the lyke againe
at the next houre. Cothe he: I will se that. In the meane
time, the Coppagaw, being a wyse man, and doubted
whether I hade so appoynted it or no, for he knew that it
would goo of it selfe but 4 times in 24 houres, so he cam
unto me, for I did stand under the house sid, wheare
I myghte heare the orgon goo, and he asked me yf it
would goo againe at the end of the nexte houre; but
I tould him that it would not, for I did thinke the Grand
Sinyor would not have stayed so longe by it; but yf it
would please him, that when the clocke had strouk he
would tuche a litle pin with his finger, which before I had
shewed him, it would goo at any time. Than he sayde
that he would be as good as his worde to the Grand Sinyor.
When the clocke began to strick againe, the Coppagaw
went and stood by it; and when the clocke had strouke
23, he tuched that pinn, and it did the lyke as it did
before. Than the Grand Sinyor sayed it was good. He
satt verrie neare vnto it, ryghte before the Keaes (keys),
wheare a man should playe on it by hande. He asked
whye those keaes did move when the orgon wente and
nothinge did tuche them. He Tould him that by those
thinges it myghte be played on at any time. Than the
Grande Sinyor asked him yf he did know any man that
could playe on it. He sayd no, but he that came with it
coulde, and he is heare without the dore. Fetche him
hether, cothe the Grand Sinyor, and lett me se how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
dothe it. Than the Coppagaw opened that Dore which
I wente out at, for I stoode neare unto it. He came
and touke me by the hande, smylinge upon me; but
I bid my drugaman aske him what I should dow, or
whither I shoulde goo. He answered that it was the
Grand Sinyore’s pleasur that I should lett him se me playe
on the orgon. So I wente with him. When I came
within the Dore, That which I did se was verrie wonderfull
unto me. I cam in direcktly upon the Grand Sinyore’s
ryghte hande, som 16 of my passis (paces) from him, but
he would not turne his head to louke upon me. He satt
in greate state, yeat the sighte of him was nothinge in
Comparrison of the traine that stood behinde him, the
sighte whearof did make me almoste to thinke that I was
in another worlde. The Grand Sinyor satt still, behouldinge
the presente which was befor him, and I stood daslinge my
eyes with loukinge upon his people that stood behinde
him, the which was four hundrethe persons in number.
Tow hundrethe of them weare his princepall padgis, the
yongest of them 16 yeares of age, som 20, and som 30.
They weare apparled in ritche clothe of goulde made in
gowns to the mydlegge; upon theire heades litle caps of
clothe of goulde, and som clothe of Tissue<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>; great peecis of
silke abowte theire wastes instead of girdls; upon their
leges Cordivan buskins,<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> reede. Theire heades wear all
shaven, savinge that behinde Their ears did hange a locke
of hare like a squirel’s taile; theire beardes shaven, all
savinge theire uper lips. Those 200 weare all verrie
proper men, and Christians borne.</p>

<p>The thirde hundrethe weare Dum men, that could nether
heare nor speake, and theye weare likwyse in gouns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
riche Clothe of gould and Cordivan buskins; bute theire
Caps weare of violett velvett, the croune of them made
like a lether bottell, the brims devided into five picked
(peaked) corneres. Som of them had haukes in theire fistes.</p>

<p>The fourthe hundrethe weare all dwarffs, bige-bodied
men, but verrie low of stature. Everie Dwarfe did weare
a simmeterrie (scimitar) by his side, and they weare also
apareled in gowns of Clothe of gould.</p>

<p>I did moste of all wonder at those dumb men, for they
lett me understande by theire perfitt sins (signs) all thinges
that they had sene the presente dow by its motions.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>When I had stode almost one quarter of an houre
behouldinge this wonder full sighte, I harde the Grande
Sinyore speake unto the Coppagaw, who stood near unto
him. Than the Coppagaw cam unto me, and touke my
cloake from aboute me, and laye it Doune upon the
Carpites, and bid me go and playe on the organ; but
I refused to do so, because the Grand Sinyor satt so neare
the place wheare I should playe that I could not com at
it, but I muste needes turne my backe Towardes him and
touche his Kne with my britchis, which no man, in paine
of deathe, myghte dow, savinge only the Coppagaw. So he
smyled, and lett me stande a litle. Than the Grand Sinyor
spoake againe, and the Coppagaw, with a merrie countenance,
bid me go with a good curridge, and thruste me
on. When I cam verrie neare the Grand Sinyor, I bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
my heade as low as my kne, not movinge my cape, and
turned my backe righte towardes him, and touched his kne
with my britchis.</p>

<p>He satt in a verrie ritche Chaire of estate, upon his
thumbe a ringe with a diamon in it halfe an inche square,
a faire simeterie by his side, a bow, and a quiver of Arros.</p>

<p>He satt so righte behinde me that he could not se what
I did; tharfore he stood up, and his Coppagaw removed
his Chaire to one side, wher he myghte se my handes;
but, in his risinge from his chaire, he gave me a thruste
forwardes, which he could not otherwyse dow, he satt so
neare me; but I thought he had bene drawinge his sorde
to cut of my heade.</p>

<p>I stood thar playinge suche thinge as I coulde untill
the cloke stroucke, and than I boued my heade as low as I
coulde, and wente from him with my backe towardes him.
As I was taking of my cloake, the Coppagaw came unto
me and bid me stand still and lett my cloake lye; when
I had stood a litle whyle, the Coppagaw bid me goo and
cover the Keaes of the organ; then I wente Close to the
Grand Sinyor againe, and bowed myselfe, and then I wente
backewardes to my Cloake. When the Company saw me
do so theye semed to be glad, and laughed. Than I saw
the Grand Sinyor put his hande behind him full of goulde,
which the Coppagaw Receved, and broughte unto me fortie
and five peecis of gould called chickers,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and than was I
put out againe wheare I came in, beinge not a little joyfull
of my good suckses.</p>

<p>Beinge gotten oute of the surralia, I made all the spede
I could to that gate where the imbassador wente in, for he
and all his Company stode all these tow houres expecktinge
the Grand Sinyors cominge to another place whear he
should deliver his imbassege and Letteres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>When I came to that greate gate I sawe our Imbassador
takeinge horse to begone. As I was making haste towardes
him, he saw me, and came to me, Askinge me yf the Grand
Sinyor had sene the presente. I tould him yeas, and that
I had sene the Grand Sinyor, and that I had gould out of
his pockett; whearat he semed to be verrie glade.</p>

<p>As he was speakinge unto me thar cam towe brave
Turkes ridinge to my lord, bidinge him take his place
and staye a litle; than my lord bid me take my place
awhyle, for he desiered to heare more of that good
neues.</p>

<p>So, when everie man had taken his place, thare was a
greate gate opened on one side of the courte, and sodenly
thar came oute at that gate five hundreth men on horsbacke,
whose habbittes wear strainge to us, and their
horsis wear verrie good.</p>

<p>Lykwyse thare came 500 jenisaris on foute, everie man
havinge in his hande a great cane like unto a beadles
staffe, and theye wear also in a strange habitt. This
thousande men did but only cross the Courte for a show;
they beinge gone, thar came sixe brave Turkes, well
mounted, to our imbassador, and conducted him to the
water side.</p>

<p>When my Lord was com to his owne house, he, with the
12 jentlmen, entred into his Chamber, and than he sente
for me to tell him in what maner the Grand Sinyor had
sene the presente, and how I came to se him. When I
hade tould them the discource of it, they weare all verrie
glad that he did so well like the presente; but my lorde
sat still a good whyle, and said nothinge untill one asked
him what he did stodie, on seinge althinges proved so well.
My lord Answeared him, that he was sorye for onethinge,
the which was that he never had any thoughte of my
cominge into the Grand Sinyors presence, nether that any
other would make it doubtful unto him, for if he had but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
mystrusted it never so litle, he would have bestowed 30 or
40<i>li.</i> in apparell for me.</p>

<p>The laste of September I was sente for againe to the
surralia to sett som thinges in good order againe, which
they had altered, and those tow jemoglans which kepte
that house made me verrie kindly welcom, and asked me
that I would be contented to stay with them always, and I
should not wante anythinge, but have all the contentt that
I could desier. I answered them that I had a wyfe and
Childrin in Inglande, who did expecte my returne. Than
they asked me how long I had been married, and how
many children I hade. Thoughe in deede I had nether
wyfe nor childrin, yeat to excuse my selfe I made them
that Answeare.</p>

<p>Than they toulde me that yf I would staye the Grand
Sinyor would give tow wyfes, ether tow of his Concubines
or els tow virgins of the beste I Could Chuse my selfe, in
Cittie or contrie.</p>

<p>The same nyghte, as my Lorde was at supper, I tould
him what talke we had in the surralya, and whate they did
offer me to staye thare, and he bid me that by no meanes
I should flatly denie them anythinge, but be as merrie with
them as I could, and tell them that yf it did please my
Lorde that I should stay, I should be the better contented
to staye; by that meanes they will not go about to staye
you by force, and yow may finde a time the better to goo
awaye when you please.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">October.</span></h4>

<p>The seconde of October my Lord Imbassader held a
feaste abord our ship, and invited the baylie of Venis and
sartaine Turks.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The 12, beinge Fridaye, I was sente for to the Courte,
and also the Sondaye and Monday folloinge, to no other
end but to show me the Grand Sinyors privie Chamberes,
his gould and silver, his chairs of estate; and he that
showed me them would have me to sitt downe in one of
them, and than to draw that sord out of the sheathe with
the which the Grand Sinyor doth croune his kinge.</p>

<p>When he had showed me many other thinges which I
wondered at, than crossinge throughe a litle squar courte
paved with marble, he poynted me to goo to a graite in a
wale, but made me a sine that he myghte not goo thether
him selfe. When I came to the grait the wale was verrie
thicke, and graited on bothe the sides with iron verrie
strongly; but through that graite I did se thirtie of the
Grand Sinyor’s Concobines that weare playinge with a
bale in another courte. At the firste sighte of them I
thoughte they had bene yonge men, but when I saw the
hare of their heades hange doone on their backes, platted
together with a tasle of smale pearle hanginge in the lower
end of it, and by other plaine tokens, I did know them to
be women, and verrie prettie ones in deede.</p>

<p>Theie wore upon theire heades nothinge bute a litle capp
of clothe of goulde, which did but cover the crowne of her
heade; no bandes a boute their neckes, nor anythinge but
faire cheans of pearle and a juell hanginge on their breste,
and juels in their ears; their coats weare like a souldier’s
mandilyon,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> som of reed sattan and som of blew, and som
of other collors, and girded like a lace of contraire collor;
they wore britchis of scamatie,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> a fine clothe made of coton
woll, as whyte as snow and as fine as lane<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>; for I could
desarne the skin of their thies throughe it. These britchis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
cam doone to their mydlege; som of them did weare fine
cordevan buskins, and som had their leges naked, with a
goulde ringe on the smale of her legg; on her foute a
velvett panttoble<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> 4 or 5 inches hie. I stood so longe
loukinge upon them that he which had showed me all this
kindnes began to be verrie angrie with me. He made a
wrye mouthe, and stamped with his foute to make me give
over looking; the which I was verrie lothe to dow, for
that sighte did please me wondrous well.</p>

<p>Than I wente awaye with this Jemoglane to the place
wheare we lefte my drugaman or intarpreter, and I tould
my intarpreter that I had sene 30 of the Grand Sinyores
Concobines; but my intarpreter advised me that by no
meanes I should speake of it, whearby any Turke myghte
hear of it; for if it weare knowne to som Turks, it would
presente deathe to him that showed me them. He durste
not louke upon them him selfe. Although I louked so
longe upon them, theie saw not me, nether all that whyle
louked towards that place. Yf they had sene me, they
would all have come presently thether to louke upon me,
and have wondred as moche at me, or how I cam thether,
as I did to se them.</p>

<p>The nexte daye our shipp caled the Heckter, beinge
reddie to departe, I wente to carrie my beed and my
Chiste aborde the shipp. Whyleste I was aborde the shipp,
thar came a jemoglane or a messenger from the surralia
to my lord imbassador, with an express comand that the
shipp should not departe, but muste stay the Grand
Sinyores pleasur. When my lord hard this messidge,
with suche a comande, he begane to wonder what the
Cause should be. He thoughte that thare hade bene som
forfitt made, or that som of the chips company had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
horte or given som greate offence unto som greate person;
but, what so ever it was, he knew that the Grand Sinyores
comande must be obayed; tharefore, when he had stodied
longe what the cause myghte be, and beinge verrie desirus
to know the truthe, he wente to the messenger and desiered
him to tell him the cause whye the Grand Sinyor had
sente this comande, or whearfore it should be.</p>

<p>The messenger tould him that he did not know the
cause whye, nether whearfore, but he did hearde the chia
say that yf the workman that sett up the presente in the
surralia would not be perswaded to stay be hind the shipe,
the ship muste staye untill he had removed the presente
unto another place.</p>

<p>When my lord had got thus muche out of him, he began
to be somwhat merrie, for he was muche greved before,
thinkinge it had bene a greater matter; for the martchantes
was bound in 5 hundrethe pounde unto the owneres of the
shipe that she should departe that day, which was the
Thursday folloing, yf wynd and wether sarved; also for
the time that she stayed there her Chargis was everie day
20<i>li.</i></p>

<p>Than my Lorde inquiered for me and sente one to the
ship whear I was, who tould me that I muste com presently
to my Lorde; so when I came to my lorde I found with
him another messinger, who broughte the sartaintie of the
matter that it was for no other cause but for my stainge to
remove the organ; but when my lord tould me that I muste
be contented to staye and Lette the ship goo, than was
I in a wonderfull perplixatie, and in my furie I tould
my lorde that that was now com to pass which I ever
feared, and that was that he in the end would betray me,
and turne me over into the Turkes hands, whear I should
Live a slavish Life, and never companie againe with
Christians, with many other suche-like words.</p>

<p>My Lord verrie patiently gave me leve to speake my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
mynde. Than he lay his hand on my shoulder and tould
that as he was a Christian him selfe, and hooped tharby to
be saved, it was no plote of his, nether did he know of any
suche matter as this till the messinger came. In the ende
cothe he: Be yow contented to staye, and let the ship goo;
and it shall coste me 5 hundrethe pound rether than yow
shalbe Compeled to staye a day Longer than yow are
willinge your selfe after yow have removed the presente;
and yow shall stay heare as longe as yow will, and goo
assoune as yow will, or when yow will make choice of
your company; and yow shall wante nothinge, silver or
gould, to carry yow by seae or Lande, and goo muche
safer and more for your pleasur ten times than yow could
to go with the shipe, for the ship goethe to Scanderoune,
in the botem of the straites, which is oute of her way
homwardes, and thare will staye a monthe at leaste to
take in her loadinge; and the place is so corrupte and
unhe(lth)full that many of her men will thare grow sick
and die, and yow shall by this means be oute of that
dainger.</p>

<p>My Lorde did speake this so frindly and nobly unto me,
that upon a sodon he had altered my mynde, and I tould
him that I would yeld my selfe into Godes hand and his.</p>

<p>Than said my Lorde: I thanke yow, I will send to the
shipe for suche thinges as yow desier to have lefte behinde,
for yow muste goo presently to the surralia to se the place
wheare yow muste sett up the presente, or els they thinke
that yow mean not to com at all; so away wente I with my
drugaman or interpreter my ould way to the surralia gates,
the which they willingly opened, and bid me welcom when
I came to that house wheare the presente did stande.
Those jemoglanes, my ould acquaintance which kept that
house, and had bene appointed by the Grand Sinyor to
perswade me to staye thare allwayes, as indeed theie had
done diveres times and diveres wayes, now they thoughte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
that I would staye in deed, theye imbraced me verrie
kindly, and kiste me many times. What my drugaman
said to them I know not, but I thinke he tould them that
I would not staye, tharfore, when I was gone oute of the
house doune som 4 or 5 steps into a courte, as I was
puting on my pantabls, one of these jemoglanes cam behinde
me and touke me in his armes and Carried me up
againe into the house, and sett me doune at that dore
wheare all the Grand Sinyore’s brothers weare strangled
that daye he was made Emprore. My interpreter folloed
apase. When he that carried me had sette me doune, I bid
my drugaman aske him why he did so, and he, seinge me
louk merrely, he him selfe laughed hartaly, and saide that
he did so but to se how I would tak it yf they should
staye me by force. Than I bid my drugaman tell him
that they should not need to go aboute to staye me by
force, for I did staye willingly to doo the Grand Sinyor all
the sarvis that I could.</p>

<p>Than these 2 jemoglanes wente with me to show me the
house wheare unto the presente should be removed.</p>

<p>The waye was verrie pleasante throughte the garthens,
whear did grow store of siprus trees and many orther good
frute trees in verrie comly and desent order. Beinge paste
the gardens, we entred upon a faire grene, wheare we founde
som galland Turks ridinge horses on the easte sid of that
grene or plain upon the wale of the surralia. Close to the
sea sid Dothe stande a prittie fine litle buldinge which
theye cale a Cuske (kiosk), made for a bancketinge house;
but espetially, as I persaved, it is a place wheare the
Grand Sinyor dothe use to meet his Congquebines twyse
in the weeke. It is finly covered with Leade, and bulded
squear on the topp; in the midle a litle square tour like a
peramadease (pyramid?) on a greate heighte, and on the
top of that a litle turrett well gildede, and on the side
nexte to the sea a faire large gallarie wheare men may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
stande and se bothe up and doune the rever of Hellisponte,
and lik wyse over it into Asia.</p>

<p>On the other 3 sids towards the grene ar verrie larg
pentazis (pent-houses), supported with fine marble pillers,
the flore spred with fair carpites, the roufe under the
pentas verrie Curiusly wroughte withe gould and collors;
but cominge into it it is a litle wonder, I cannot duly
discrib it; but the roufe is a round hollo, verrie curiosly</p>

<p class="center">[<i>A page is lost here.</i>]</p>

<p class="noindent">pipes and Laid them in order on the carpites. By chance
I caled to my drugaman and asked him the cause of
theire runinge awaye; than he saide the Grand Sinyor and
his Conquebines weare cominge, we muste be gone in
paine of deathe; but they run all away and lefte me
behinde, and before I gott oute of the house they weare
run over the grene quit out at the gate, and I runn as
faste as my leggss would carrie me aftere, and 4 neageres
or blackamoors cam runinge towardes me with their
semetaries drawne; yf they could have catchte me theye
would have hewed me all in peecis with there semeteris.
When I cam to the wickett or gate, thare stood a great
number of jemoglanes, praying that I myghte escape the
handes of those runninge wolves; when I was got out of the
gate they weare verrie joyfull that I had so well escaped
their handes. I stayed not thare, but touke boate and
went presently to my Lord and tould him how I had run
for my life. Asoune as my drugaman came home, my lord
made him beleve that he would hange him for leaving me
in that dainger; but at laste granted him his Life, but
forbid him to com to his any more. He was a Turke, but
a Cornishe man borne. Now, as I was runinge for my life,
I did se a litle of a brave show, which was the Grand
Sinyor him selfe on horsbacke, many of his conquebines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
som ridinge and som on foute, and brave fellowes in their
kinde, that weare gelded men, and keepers of the conquebines;
neagers that weare as blacke as geate (jet), but
verrie brave; by their sides great semeteris; the scabertes
semed to be all goulde, etc.</p>

<p>The 21, my Lord would not suffer me to goo to worke,
because it was our Sabothe daye.</p>

<p>And that did louse me somthinge, for that daye the
Grand Sinyor had appointed to com and sitt by me to se
how I put my worke together, and was come upon the
grene, which when the jemoglanes persaved, they run to
mete him, and tould him that I came not to worke that
daye. Than he returned againe, and thoughte that I had
kepte my selfe awaye of purpse, and tharefore he would
not com any more.</p>

<p>The 24 my worke was finished.</p>

<p>The 25 I wente to that place againe with the Coppagaw,
to show him somethinges in the presente, and to se that I
had lefte nothinge amise.</p>

<p>And than those jemoglanes was verrie earneste with me
in perswation to stay and live thare.</p>

<p>The Laste of October my Lord imbassader wente to the
vizear’s house with all his train of Inglish men; for that
daye the vizear<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> had appointed to end a contrivarcie which
was betwixte him and the Franche imbassader<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>; but the
Franche imbassader seinge us go by his house with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
greater company than he could make, he would not com
after us, the which was litle for his credditt. The 2 imbassaders
made sute bothe for one thinge, and the vizear
recaved great bribes of the Franche imbassader.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">November.</span></h4>

<p>The 12th of November I wente to Andranople gate,
that is the farthest gate of Constantinople, towardes
Andranople. Upon a goodly plaine withoute that gate, I
se a carravan of the Taleste (tallest) Camels that ever I had
sene in all my time. Than we returned into the Cittie to see
Diverse monymentes, the which I would not for anything
but that I had sene them. I have not time now to wryte
them, but of force muste leave them un named untill a
time of better Leasur.</p>

<p>This daye, in the morninge, I put on a pare of new
shoues, and wore them quite oute before nyghte; but this
daye I touke a great could with a surfett, by means whearof
I was sore trubled with a burninge fever, and in great
dainger of my Life. When I was somthinge recovered, by
the helpe of God and a good fisition, it hapened that thar
was good Company reddie to com for Inglande, suche as
in 2 or 3 years I could not have had the lik, if I had stayed
behinde them, and they weare all desierus to have my
company. My Lord was verrie unwillinge that I should
goo at that time, because I was verrie wayke, not able to
goo on foute one myle in a daye. But I desiered my lord
to give me leve, for I had rether die by the way in doinge
my good will to goo hom than staye to die thare, wheare
I was perswaded I could not live if I did staye behinde
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Of our Pasige by See to Vola (Volo) in Romalea.</span></h4>

<p>My lord Ambassador would have me to carrie may beed
with me, and gave order for the carreinge of it on ship
borde, and also that when we came to travell by lande that
I should have one horse to carrie me, and another to carrie
my beed and my Clothes.</p>

<p>The 28 of November, beinge Weddensdaye, at 4 acloke
in the after nowne, we departed from the cittie of Constantinople
and Gallata in a Turkishe ship caled Carmesale,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
in the which we had a discontented voyege, the Mr.
and sailer wear so barbarus.</p>

<p>The nexte daye we came to the tow Castles caled Sestoes
and Abidose, wheare som of our company wente
ashore and touke in as good wyne as the worlde yeldethe,
but it was but for their owne provition.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">December.</span></h4>

<p>The firste of December we departed from thence, and
after 7 myles we came to the ruins of Troy, and sailed
behinde Tennidose, leavinge it on our Lefte hande.</p>

<p>The wynde beinge tow Large for our waike (weak)
shipp, we came to an anker at the iland Lemnos the same
daye.</p>

<p>At this place we weare in greate dainger of beinge caste
awaye.</p>

<p>The sixte day we sett saile againe, havinge a faire wynde,
but towardes nyghte we weare becalmed.</p>

<p>The 7th daye, the wynde beinge contrarie, we came to
an anker by the shore of Romalea, the maine lande of
Grece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The 8 day, the wynde cominge faire, we sett saile, and
entred the rever.</p>

<p>The nexte morninge, beinge Sunday, we arived at Vola,
in Romalea, the maine of Greece, not farr from Thessalonica.</p>

<p>The 10th we touke horsis, and began our jurnaye by
land over the Confines of Thessale.</p>

<p>The 12th daye, at nyghte, we came to a towne caled
Zetoune.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Beinge come to this towne, our horsis and mayls
(mules) returned to Vola; and heare we rested tow dayes.
I may say rested, for I am sure we had no reste in the
nyghte, our lodginge was so bade, be side the greate feare
we wear in of haveinge our throtes cutt. The beste comoditie
we had was that we had good store of good wyne and
good cheape (sheep).</p>

<p>Heare we hired freshe horsis and mayles (mules). We
weare but 8 men, yeat we had everie daye 12 horsis....
Four of them weare to carrie our clothes, my beed, and
wyne and vitell for 3 dayes. For some nyghtes we weare like
to ly without dors, and at som touns we could not gitt any
vitels. Whyle we weare in this toune we weare warned
to keep close, for thar weare som of the Grand Sinyor’s
souldiers that weare cominge from the wars.</p>

<p>The 14th we departed from Zetoun, and haveing rid 6 or
7 myles, we began to climbe the hills of Parnassus, wheare
we had all maner of ill wether, as thundringe, lightninge,
rayne, and snow, and our waye was so bad as I thinke
never did Christians travell the like. The mountains
weare huge and steepe, stony, and the wayes verrie narrow,
so that if a horse should have stumbled or slided,
bothe horse and man had bene in greate dainger of theire
lives.</p>

<p>Also we weare doged, or followed, by 4 stout villans that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
weare Turkes. They would have perswaded our drugaman,
which was our gid (guide), to have given his consente
unto the Cuttinge of our throtes in the nyghte, and he did
verrie wysely Conseale it from us, and delayed the time
with them, not daringe to denye ther sute; and so theye
followed us 4 dayes over Parnassus; but our drugaman
everie nyghte give us charge to keepe good watche, espetialy
this laste nyghte, for theye did purpose to goo no farther
after us, and our Turke, whome I cale our drugaman, had
premeded (permitted) them that that nyghte it should be
don. Now, after he had given us warninge to kepe good
watche, he wente unto them and made them drinke so
muche wyne, or put somthinge in there wyne, that theye
weare not only drunke but also sicke, that they weare not
able to attempte anythinge againste us to hurt us, for
the which we had verrie greate cause to give hartie thanks
unto Almyghtie God, who was our chefeste savgaurd.</p>

<p>This nighte we Laye in a lytle village under a wonderfull
heie rocke. Thoughe that countrie be contenually
could, yeate the wemen thare never weare anythinge on
their feete; they ar verrie well favored, but their feete be
blacke and broade.</p>

<p>This man that was sente with us to be our drugaman, or
intarpreater, was an Inglishe man, borne in Chorlaye in
Lancashier; his name Finche. He was also in religon a
perfit Turke, but he was our trustie frende.</p>

<p>The nexte daye, beinge the 17th, we came to Lippanta,<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
wheare our Turke revealed all this unto us, and these
men we had sene, but never more than one at once, and
he never stayed longe in our companye, for he came but
to speake with our Turke aboute their vilanus plott.</p>

<p>This day we had bothe wynter and somer; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
morning we did tread upon froste and snowe; before
nowne we came to the bottem of the mountaine, wheare
did run a rever, so bige and stifly, beinge fulle of stons, so
that we durste not adventur to rid over it; but our Turke,
ridinge up and doune by the rever sid, espied tow stoute
fellowes, the which wear naked and more than halfe
savidge or wyld; he caled them unto him, and they
unwilingly came. Than when he had talked with them,
he comanded one of them to take his horse by the bridle
and leade him throughe the rever, and so he did, havinge
a greate stafe in his hand; than the other savige man
touke Mr. Paul Pinder’s horse by the heade and led him
over, and than Sir Humfray Conisby his horse, and so
one after a other. This rever was thicke and moddie, and
was no other than mearly snow water, that dothe desend
from those hils wheare it dothe contenualy snow.</p>

<p>Longe before nyghte we came to Lippanta, whiche is a
greate haven toune. The people in it ar Turkes, Greekes,
and Jues (Jews); but the greateste parte be Jues, the
second Turkes. This Lippanta is a good haven toone,
lyethe close to the sea, in the risinge of a hill, and upon
that hill is a castell, the which hathe 2 counter wales,
etc.</p>

<p>In diverse partes of the toune are verrie fine Springs of
exelente watter, and som of them do drive myls, the
which myls be verrie straingly made, for only one water
whele, withoute any cogwhele or anythinge els, dothe
turne the stone, and will grinde 30 bushils a daye and
upwards.</p>

<p>To make the like I am able to giv direckion.</p>

<p>Aboute this toune theye make greate store of verrie
pleasante wynes, bothe whyte and reed.</p>

<p>Also heare dothe grow good store of Currante, greate
plentie of orringis and lemons, palm sidrons, palm garnetes
(pomegranates), dates and almons, and verrie good ayle
(oil).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>We lodged heare 3 nyghtes in the house of a Jew, who
is by Inglishe men caled the honeste Jew, for he is verrie
lovinge unto Inglishe men.</p>

<p>The 20th daye we touke a boote and croste the Gulfe of
Lippanta, and the same nyghte came to Petras (Patras), in
Morea. All our way thether we weare in good hoope to have
hade greate entertainmente thare by Mr. Jonas Aldredge,
an Inglish man who was Consoll thare; but he was gone
40 myles from home to hange a Jew. By misinge of him
we weare constrained to lodge at a Romain’s<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> house in
suche maner as we (did) all our jurney; for thouge we
had house roum enoughe, yeat we laye in our clothes
upon the grounde, savinge at the Jewe’s house in Lippanta
thare was tow bed steades, Inglishe fation; but those
would not sarve us all.</p>

<p>At this place Mr. Cunisbe was like to have cutt of
a Jew’s heade, who railed againste our Saviour; but Mr.
Paull Pinder and the reste of our Company, with muche
at dow, prevented it.</p>

<p>This Petrace (Patras) is in Morea, ether adjoyninge or
a parte of Greece. Hear is a good porte for ships; but
the towne is neare halfe a myle from the sea, in the risinge
of a hill. A litle a bove the towne is a castle, but the
towne and Castele ar but of smale strength.</p>

<p>Hear is indiferente store of Currante and ayle, and
greate store of corne, for theye doo sell som to other
contris that wante; also good store of goates and shepe
and other catle. Because som of our companye was sicke,
we restede heare 3 dayes.</p>

<p>The 24, being Christmas Eeve, we proseded in our
jurnaye throughe Morrea. A bout nowne we came to
a rever that we muste pass throughe; and, determaninge
thare to baite, for we ever had vitals reddie dreste for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
3 dayes, we pitched and placed ourselves under the alder
trees, to kepe us from the son; for thoughe it was Christmas
eve, yeat we thoughte it to be as hoate wether as we have
it in Inglande at Whitsontide, and swallowes came fliinge
a bout us. Our dinner ended, we croste the rever, and
entred into a foreste-like Cuntrie, wheare we saw nether
towne nor villidge, but somtime a shipheardes Hoote (hut).
At nyghte we founde 3 litle pore cottidges. In this wylde
cuntrie, wheare we rested the moste part of the nyght;
and whyle 4 of us slepte, the other 4 did watche, for we
touke the place to be daingerus to sleepe it. I was one of
the 4 that did watche in the fore parte of the nyghte.
Betwixte 11 and 12 of the clocke we saw a bale of fierr, as
bigge as a greate foot bale,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> risinge out of the easte, and
did rise of a greate heighte, and did give a greate lighte;
than, faulinge towardes the weste, the lighte and fier bothe
was less and less. Mr. Conisbe was verrie sorie that he
had not sene that fier bale.</p>

<p>At 4 a clocke in the morninge, beinge Christmas daye,
we Sett forwardes. This day we could not number the
heardes of swine which we saw and paste throughe, and
also heardes of shepe and goates, and we weare verrie
muche trubled wethe shepheardes’ doggs, the which weare
like to pluck us of our horsis.</p>

<p>This cuntrie is a parte of the plains of Arcadia. Aboute
(an) howre we cam to a villidge, wheare we did thinke to
have boughte som vittels, but we could gitt nothinge but 8
egges.</p>

<p>When we weare a myle oute of this towne upon the
plains, the day before was verrie fair, but now thar fell a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sodon shower of raine, the which came downe as if it had
bene powered downe with bouls, and no winde; but our
horsis stood stone still, and would not stur one foote. The
shower lasted not a bove halfe a quarter of an hour, and
for a great parte of that time for a myle round aboute us
we could se no ground for water. Upon a sodon it seaste,
and the water was gone, all savinge som which laye in
hollow placis.</p>

<p>Pasinge throughe this plaine, upon our righte hande we
myghte se the seae, and upon the sandes an infinite company
of wyld swans.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Upon our lefte hande we sawe highe
mountains.</p>

<p>At nyghte we came to a Castell, caled Castell Turneaes,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
the which dothe stand upon a verrie hie hill, posseste with
a garreson of Turkes, and is 3 myles from the seae. It is
a Castele that may be kepte with a verrie few men. The
waye to it is so lade<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> that ordenance cannot be broughte
anythinge near it.</p>

<p>On St. Stevn’s Day we did thinke to have croste a parte
of the sea to the iland Zante, but the wynde was so hie
that we could not.</p>

<p>On St. John’s Day, the wynde beinge somwhat abatted,
we carried our supportes<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and other Lugedge to the seasid,
wheare we weare in hoope to find som boats. Cominge
thether, we founde a great markett of swyne and other
cattell, and so thar is everie day, beinge faire weather. The
iland Zante hathe all theire provition of vittell from thence.
From this place it is but 12 or 18 myles by sea, yeate we
had muche adow to hier a hogge boate to carrie us to
Zante. For our passage and carriege of our stufe we payed
seven Chickens (sequins), or 7 pecis of gould which weare
nyne shillinges a peece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Heare, at the sea sid, we parted from our drugaman,
or the Turke that was our gidd from Constantinople.
Thoughe he was a Turke, his righte name was Finche,
borne at Chorlaye in Longcashier.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Our Entertainment at Zante.</span></h4>

<p>Beinge come to Zante, we could not be permited to goe
a shore, because the governers of the toune did understand
that we came from Constantinople, or oute of Turkie.
It (is) ther Custom to deale so with all straingers that come
out of Turkie, if they have not a letter of health from some
Venitian or Ittalian.</p>

<p>So by the judgimente of the Provodore and the tow
Sinyors of Healthe, we wear comited to the lazaretto, which
is a prison for all suche travelers, and thare to remaine for
10 dayes; and if, at the ende of 10 dais, any man be
founde sicke when the Sinyors of Healthe com to examon
and se them, than they muste remaine thare for 10 daies
more.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Jennarie.</span></h4>

<p>By suche meanes as our martchantes who ar facktors
thare did use, we had poticke (pratique) the 6 of Jenuarie,
but at our firste cominge we weare in doubte to have laine
thare longer in this prison, but we hade a greate favor
showede us, for we weare not put into the ordenarie preson,
but into a new house wheare never any bodie had dwelte,
and it was cloce to the seae. Also the water men which
brought us from Castell Turneas<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> was commited with us,
because they broughte us in theire boote; and we weare
constrained to finde them vittals for 7 dayes; for than the
Sinyors of Healthe came unto us to se if any man weare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sicke. Than Mr. Paule Pinder desiered that they would
releace the water men, and ease us of that charge. So
theye weare contented that the water men should have proticke,
or libertie, if theye would leape out at a window into
the sea, and washe them selues over heade with theyer
clothis on; the which theye weare verrie lothe to dow, but
Mr. Connisbye drew his simmeterie, and swore a greate
othe that if they would not leape out quickly he would cut
of theier legges, and made them perforce leap oute; and so
we weare rid of them.</p>

<p>Many thinges which hapened in the time of our impresoment,
for wante of time I doo omit.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Februarie.</span></h4>

<p>We stayed in the iland of Zante fortie and 6 dayes, ever
expectinge som ship to com in thare that would Carrie us
to Venis, or els for Inglande, but the firste that came war
the Heckter, in the which I wente out of Inglande; and we
did thinke that she by that time had bene in Inglande.
When I saw her I was somwhat sorie, for I had a great
desier to have gone to Venis; but yeat I was glad againe,
because I knew that in her was a sur passidge, and
emongste men that did know me.</p>

<p>The 26 of Februarie, in the morninge, we departed from
Zante. The nexte day we had ill wether and the wynd
contrarie, so that we returned again, and went in at
Safflanee,<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> in Morea. In our company was the Edward
Boneventur<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and the Swallow. In that harbur we founde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the great Susan<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> of London, a ship of 3 hundrethe tun;
and thare was the Riall Defence of Brstoll. The laste of
this monthe cam in thare the martchante Boniventur.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Marche 1599.</span></h4>

<p>The firste of Marche came in a litle shipe caled the
Diamon.</p>

<p>In this contrie is verrie good muscadine,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and thar is also
som Currante. This harbur is verrie good; what wether
so ever blow, a ship is without dainger thare. On the
weste sid dothe stand a pretie toune caled Luksere<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>; on
the easte, a Castell. When we wente to sea from hence
we weare in Company eighte ships; beinge 4 or 5 leages
at sea, the wynde came contrarie, and like to be foule
wether, so that we returned againe to the same harber; in
the morninge the wynde came fair againe, and we sett
saile againe.</p>

<p>The sixte daye we paste the Gulfe of Venis, the which
daye the wynde came all southe weste a smale gale, so
that we could not keepe our course; but as we weare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
turninge in the nighte, the wynde came faire at southe
and by easte, and contenued the nexte daye.</p>

<p>The 9th daye we descried Mount Etnaye, but thare it
is caled Muntabell,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> the burninge mountaine in Cisillia. In
the Afternoone we came under the shore of the same
lande; at the firste we did thinke to com to an anker
because the wynd was bad, yeate torninge up and downe
by the shore, we saw the watche toweres make lightes at
the topp of theire tours, to shew unto other watche toures
how many ships they saw that weare not theire frendes;
for thare be of those touers round aboute the iland, so that
yf one Touer do show so many lightes one after another
as they se ships, it will goo round aboute the iland in a
verrie shorte time. Yf we had com to an anker we feared
them note, but theye weare a frayed of us; yeat doubtinge
the wynde would be worse, or else no wynd at all,
we kept at sea. The next day we weare so neare the
shore that we saw a greate company of souldiers, bothe
horse and foote, gathered together.</p>

<p>For all that, towardes eyghte we came to an anker neare
the shore. When the wynde came faire, everie ship sett
saile before our Anker was upe or wayed. The other 7
ships beinge under saile, they gave chase to a Spainishe
shipe which was goinge to Malta with wheate, and when
she saw so many Inglishe ships under saile she thoughte
it better for her to goo backe againe to Sesillia than to
keepe her cource. Our shipe beinge the hindmoste of all
the 8, yeate we out wente them all, and touke that prise.
There was but 10 men in her; it was but a smale barke;
she was loden with wheate. When our sailers had pillidged
her our Mr. gave the ship and wheate to Captain Coke,
a man of ware; we had out of her verrie fine whyte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
breade and good Chese. In the nyghte folloinge thare
rise a myghtie storme, the wynde at weste, at which time
we weare 30 leages from Capp Passaro,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> wheare we weare
laste at Anker. This storme contenued 48 houres, that we
weare not able to beare any saile; in this storm the prise
which we hade taken was Caste awaye.</p>

<p>The 13th day, beinge Weddensday, we weare in sighte
of Cape Passaro againe, beinge driven backe againe thre
score Leagues, and thar came to an Anker againe, wheare
we founde a greate Flemishe shipe. That nyghte the
watche touers made lightes as they did before. The nexte
morninge we wayed Anker again, but we weare driven
further backwardes. The second nyghte after we recovered
that place againe; this truble we touke to be a punishmente
for takinge of that prise. The nexte day, beinge
Sundaye, and the 16th daye of Marche, it was verrie calme
and extreame hoote wether; at 8 a clocke at nyghte we
sett saile, for the wynde came faire at easte, but a verrie
smale gale; the next day we weare becalmed betwixte
Malta and Cesillia.</p>

<p>The 19th we mett with an Inglishe ship caled the John
and Francis, neare the coste of Cesillia, loaden with Turkes
and Jues bounde for Alicksandrea.</p>

<p>The 21, beinge Good Fridaye, the wynde came faire,
and broughte us to Panthaleara (Pantelaria).</p>

<p>One Easter day the wynd was direcktly againste us, and
drive us backe.</p>

<p>The 25, beinge Tusdaye, we mett with the Rebeka of
London and the Gren Dragon of Bristoll.</p>

<p>The 29, the wynde beinge faire, we paste by Cape Bone;
10 leagues from that we paste by a litle Ilande caled
Simbre,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> a verrie hie mountaine also the same daye by
Porta Farren,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the goinge into Tunis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The firste daye of Aprill we Croste the Gulfe of Lions.
Our vitals beinge verrie badd, I was invited to diner with
our marchantes in the great Cabbin, and beinge at diner,
we harde the crye of a mearmaide, like as yf one had
hailed our shipe; but our bootswane forbid any man to
make answeare or to louke oute.</p>

<p>The second daye the wynde came faire; the thirde day
the wynde being bade, we came to an anker at Firma<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Teara, wheare our botes wente a shore for freshe water and
stores, not inhabeted, but with bannished men thare. Neare
unto a watche tower we founde a man lyinge deade withoute
a heade, for it had bene cut of by som Turks as we
supposed. This Iland is verrie neare a place or towne
in Spaine caled Iverse.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Our ship did rid but a litle
from the toune and Castle, which Castell is verrie
stronge. The 6 daye, beinge Sondaye, in the morninge, as
we weare wayinge anker, Thare came a boate from that
toune, and broughte our marchantes for a presente tow
gootes, oringis, Lemons, leekes, and Chibbals,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and grene
beans, indeco, lettes, and other earbs. The 7th daye we
sailed by Caldaroune<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and by Alligante, which is an hondrethe
Leagues within the straites mouthe; thare we mett
with tow Flemishe sale that came from Talloune.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The 8
daye we weare becalmed before Alligante. The 9 daye we
paste by Cape Pale,<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> in the nyghte folloinge by Cape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Degate<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>; in the morninge we weare becalmed before Alama,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
a fair toune in Spaine, as it is said, not moche inferrier to
London. We weare in a maner becalmed all that daye and
the nyghte followinge.</p>

<p>This day we saw greate store of the spane (spawn) of
whales, whearof they make spermacetie; it did swym upon
the water as the whale lefte it: upon the water it showed
reed; but when we touke upe som of it in a buckete, it
was whyte, and like grease.</p>

<p>Also this daye, beinge a verrie smale gale of wynde,
a great fishe caled a storke (shark?), of a marvalus length,
did follow our ship, sid by sid, with his eyes a bove water
waytinge for a praye; for if a man had come withe in
his lengthe of the water, he would hardly have escaped
him.</p>

<p>Our Mr. goner made reddie his harpinge iron, and,
when the sutle fishe se him reddie to pitche it at him, he
staied and fell behinde the ship, and came up on the other
side, and sarved him so 2 or 3 times; but at laste he hitt
him a litle behinde the heade with a full blowe, but his
skine was so harde that the iron turned duble and would
not enter anythinge at all, only we myghte se a litle whyte
spott wheare it lighte. Nether did the fishe make any
show of felinge it, but turned him a boute, and wente
awaye direcktly from the ship.</p>

<p>The 11th daye, the wynde beinge muche againste us, as
we weare turninge to gitt somthinge of the wynde, we
came neare unto the Castell Defeare<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> in Spaine, and verrie
neare unto the shore, we loukinge still when the Castell
would shoute at us, but they would not. Than, beinge
com less than a league from the shore, we had no wynde
at all, and so it contenued all the nexte daye. By this
meanes our fleete weare scattered one a league from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
another, so that yf the Spainishe gallis had come forthe
they myghte have taken us one after another.</p>

<p>That daye it was strainge to se how the porposis did
rune in greate fleetes or scoles (shoals), in what maner it is
credable to reporte, and the noyes that they made.</p>

<p>The 13th we mett with a ship of Yarmouthe. The 15th
we came neare to Gibletore,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> wheare we mett with 3 Inglishe
men (or ships) and one Flemin, which made our fleete
14 saile; but the wynde was so contrarie that we coulde
not com neare the narrow gutt of the straite’s mouthe, but
laye becalmed unto Budgrow,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> also to Marvels,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and Grande
Malligan.</p>

<p>The 16th we weare becalmede. The nexte morninge
we saw 2 greate whalis, which wear so huge that we
thoughte them to be tow gallis or frigates: ite was an
extreame hoote day.</p>

<p>The 17th, at 10 a clocke, the wynde came faire at
northe-easte, so that aboute a 11 of the clocke at nyght
we entred into the narrow gutt, which is 4 leagues in lengthe.
At the son risinge we paste bye Cape Sprott,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> which is
10 leages withoute the straite’s mouthe, at which time we
had in our sighte 21 saile of ships.</p>

<p>The same daye, towardes nyghte, one shipe in our
Companye, caled the Rebecka, the which at that time was
the moste speedie of saile, touke her leve of us, with an
intente to bringe the firste newes into Ingland of our safe
cominge homwardes.</p>

<p>The nexte morninge, beinge the 19th, we descried Mount
Chegos,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> a hie lande in Spaine, 7 leagues from the Southe
Cape.</p>

<p>The 20th, in the morninge, beinge Sundaye, verrie arlye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
one in our mayntope saw a saille Cominge towardes us
direckly; and when we myghte well desarne the hull of
her, we did know her to be the Rebecka, the same shipe
that touke her leve of us tow dayes before to carrie newes
of our safe cominge homwards. The Cause of the returne
of that ship was for that tow galliouns of Spaine did give
Chace unto her, yeate nothinge so good of saile as she;
but the Mr. of the Rebecka thoughte them to be Carreks<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
Cominge from the Indies loden with greate welthe, whearin
he was muche desaved, for theye weare tow men-of-warr
that did ly in wayte for our ship, as afterwardes theie
confesed. When they weare come neare unto us, we did
also thinke them to be but than cominge from the Indies.
One of them was a shipe of one thousande tow hundrethe
tone, the other 8 hundrethe. Our Mr. was verrie unwillinge
to feighte with them, but our saylors was verrie
desierus; so we presently wente to prayers, and than our
gonors made reddie their ordinance, feightes<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> oute, and
everie man his place appointed, and all thinges in reddines,
we havinge the wynde of the Spanishe ships. Our ship,
caled the Heckter, laye sid by sid to the greate gallioune,
and an other Inglishe shipp Called the Greate Susan laye
close by the other, ever expectinge who would give the
firste shoute. All the other ships that weare before in our
Companye weare gone a league and more of from us,
without dainger of any shott. Thare was great odes
betwixte our shipp, that ship was caled the Great Suzana</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Here some pages are missing.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">unto him, and desiered him to give me and my mate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Harve leve to go a shore thare, and we would take poste
horse, and make what speed we Could to London; so at
laste he granted me and 3 more leve to goo, upon Condition
that we would take the Spainishe Captaine with us,
and bringe him safe unto the marchantes, the which we
promesed to doo.</p>

<p>Than we wente a shore at Dover, and our trompetes
soundinge all the waye before us into the towne, wheare
we made our selves as merrie as Could, beinge verrie
glad that we weare once againe upon Inglishe ground.
After diner, thar Came into the toune a Franche imbasseter,
beinge accompened with divers knightes and jentlmen of
Kente; so, at tow of the Clocke, we touke poste horse
to Canterburrie, and from thenc to Rochester that nyghte,
and the nexte day to London.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cap. 2.—Our Leaving the Downs, and Passage
through the Channel to Sea.</span></h4>

<p><i>Sept. 21.</i> In the morning we had a
fresh gale at N.N.E., and it so continued
between N. and E. a fair wind
for us. About half-an-hour after
eleven we set sail out of the Downes,
being seven general ships, for the
Levant; Captain Partridge in the Turkey Merchant, for
Scanderoon.</p>

<p>Our convoy were, Capt. Robinson, in the Greenwich,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> as
Admiral (who was to leave us at the next end of Candia,
and go on to Scanderoon with the Turkey Merchant), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Capt. Wild, in the Assurance, as Vice-Admiral, who was
to go with all the rest of us as far as Smyrna, with <i>Virginia
men</i>, and some <i>coasters</i> and <i>streightsmen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> We made
up in all about 100 sail going out of the Channel. I took
my passage upon the London Merchant, with that very
able and long-experienced Seaman, a most carefull and
understanding commander, Capt. John Hill, whose honest,
sober, and discreet management of all his affaires I can
never sufficiently commend, as I must never forget his
singular respect and kindnesse to myself.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cap. 3.—Our Passage from the Land’s End to
the Streightsmouth.</span></h4>

<p><i>Saturday, Sept. 24.</i> About ½ an hour past two, afternoon,
we weigh’d anchor, and stood of with an easy sail.
Next morning, by eight o’clock, we were clear of <i>the
Land’s End</i>, leaving it N. 6 W. about nine leagues, and we
told 75 sail in company.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 26.</i> The wind came up at South. It blew hard,
and brought much rain. We made several tacks, and our
<i>Freshmen</i> passengers were all in a miserable, squeamish,
and puking condition. I had held up perfectly well till
that morning, when I began (as well as the rest) to find
some odde wamblings in my stomack. Wherefore, counting
it very healthfull, at first coming to sea, to evacuate
what humours might overflow, I went and sat down in the
Captaine’s Round-house<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> on purpose to provide that designe;
for the higher any one sit within the ship, the
motion of it affects him the more, and cause his giddinesse
and <i>mawkishnesse</i> to be the greater. After I had sat there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
till I was sufficiently squeamish, I went down to the Cook
and got at least thre pints of warme small beer into my
belly, and then returned up to the Round-house again,
where the reeling of the Ship had its desired effect. I
then went down and took a second dose of warme beer,
and so came up to the Round-house again; and after
somewhat a longer pause then before, I fell to my former
exercise. This I repeated several times, till at last, when
I cam down to the <i>wast</i><a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> of the ship, and took a turn or two
there, I found my stomack begin to settle. I immediately
drank a spoonful of <i>Purle<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> royals</i> (as they call it), that is,
<i>sack and wormwood</i>, and a little while after I took as much
more. Thus for a while supping not above one spoonfull
at a time (sometimes of old Hock, sometimes of sack,
with wormwood), I afterwards continued walking gently
and santering up and down the Ship, till by noon I could
have eaten and drunk as well as any one. But I dined
onely with a little fresh broth, and as much <i>Cremor tartari</i>
in it as made it palatable; and with a cautious and
moderate diet, I was very well in lesse than 24 houres, and
I thank God I never was in the least sea-sick after in any
weather whatever.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 29.</i> The Admiral called all the Turkish commanders
on board. He told them that the Dutch and we
had chased six Algier men of War on shoar at <i>Cape
Spartel</i> (which is the most northern <i>Cape</i> of Africk, just at
the <i>Streight’s</i> mouth) not far from <i>Tangier</i>, and that we
had sunk, and fired, and destroy’d them all, and released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
many English and Dutch prisoners. He had received the
news by some Dutch Merchant ship, which that day past
by us; for all ships, if friends, when they meet upon the
sea, <i>share</i> up to one another, and sometimes lay by their
sails, or send of their boats, mutually to hear and relate
what newes they have.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, October 1st.</i> The Admiral and Vice-Admiral,
and several Commanders, came on board us, and dined
with us; and on the 3rd we all dined on board <i>the Turkey
Merchant</i>. When we thus treat one another, if the
weather be fair and will permit it, we seldome fail of
some merry fellows in every <i>ship’s crew</i>, who will entertain
us with several diversions, as divers sorts of odde Sports
and Gambols; sometimes with their homely drolls and
<i>Farses</i>, which in their corrupt language they nickname
Interlutes; sometimes they dance about the mainmast instead
of a may-pole, and they have variety of <i>forecastle
songs</i>, ridiculous enough.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 5.</i> The wind blew hard all night, and with the
labouring of the Ship the table and chaires in the great
Cabin brok loose from the cords with which they were
<i>lash’t</i>, and hurt our surgeon and some of the gentlemen
that were up there.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 7.</i> At 6 o’clock at night we saw to S.E. 25 sail going
southward, and we saw them again, next morning, about 6
o’clock. We took them for <i>Newfoundland</i> men going for
Lisbon and the Streights.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 8.</i> About 10 o’clock <i>the Burlinges</i> appear’d S. from
us (which are rocks lying of from the nethermost Cape of
the last stretch before you go into <i>Lisbon</i>). We were in
39° 55´ of latitude, and observ’d a current on those coasts
setting Southwards. That night we lay by. Next morning
we reckon’d 26 sail between us and the Rock of
Lisbon. They were Flemings, and we supposed them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
be the same which we had seen the day before standing to
the Southwards.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 9.</i> Sunday, about 2 afternoon, some Hollanders
came into our Company. It blew a violent <i>gust of</i> wind;
we lay by with our head to the westward all night till
next morning.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 11.</i> At 4 afternoon the ships from <i>Cadiz</i> or <i>Cales</i>
went in. We saw there in the Harbour a great ship at
Anchor, with the English Flag at the main top mast head,
which we concluded to be Sir Thos. Allen.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 12.</i> At noon we were in 18 fathom water northwards
of from <i>Tangier</i>. The Admiral’s boat went ashoar
to carry letters and newes, but stay’d not long, so that in
18 dayes we went from Plymouth Sound to the Streight’s
mouth.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Capt. 4.—From the Streight’s Mouth to Tunis.</span></h4>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>The seamen have a custome to demand passage-money
of every one that never past the streights before. Those
that refuse to pay, they seise them and duck them down
from <i>main yard</i> end into the Sea. There were several
that chose rather to be plunged than to part with their
money; for many that could swim would in calm weather,
for a smal reward, leap from <i>the main yard</i> and into the
Sea, but they alwayes took care to fall streight up (end
wayes) upon their feet, with their legs close, into the Sea;
for to fall otherwise so high on the water (especially upon
the belly) would bruise or spoil a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Our seamen told us that they had the very same custome
whenever they past between the <i>Burlenges</i> and the main
land of <i>Portugal</i>, in their voyages to <i>Lisbon</i>; and a French
sailor who was on board us told us of a mad ceremonious
fashion they had of dousing every freshwaterman (with
a pail of sea-water), which they nicknamed his Baptism, if
he never before had past between <i>Les Scenes</i> and the firme
land at Bretaigne.</p>

<p>Having run a convenient while on the Barbary coast, we
shar’d of toward <i>Gibraltar</i>, and Oct. 12, at 4 o’clock, we
were within lesse than a league of it, having it N. b. W.
We saw two Flag Ships in the Bay. The mountain that
overlooks the Town of old was called <i>Calpe</i>. It seem’d,
indeed, very high—much higher than <i>Abila</i>, especially
when we were near it.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The side to the south shows
reddish, and hollow’d in, as if it had been battered down
or mouldred away. The top is little and flat, and this,
perhaps, might make some of the Antients to compare it
to half of a broken pitcher inverted, or turn’d with the
bottom upwards. It shew’d very steep towards the E., but
in all its shapes as we past bye I could by no means fancy
either it or Abila in the least.</p>

<p>At six o’clock we met with two of our men of war going
out of the Streights. About 12 o’clock that night, or
something after, <i>The Pearl</i> fell foul upon our Ship, and
rent of <i>the Gallery</i> on <i>the Larboard side</i>. Some of the
passengers (who lay in the G. Cabin) were up, and one of
them had just been in that very gallery, but feeling it
somewhat cold, he did not stay, but stept into the G. cabin,
and in that very moment this damage happened. The
crash of the gallery alarmed us all, but we soon recovered
ourselves when we understood the whole matter. However,
we had all, indeed (especially that Gentleman) a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
great deliverance, for had the wind or waves become so
high as to have rowl’d <i>the Pearl</i> upon us with greater
violence, we might have (one or both) gone to the bottome.
S. D. G.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 13.</i> About 11 o’clock the whole fleet was becalm’d
on a sodain under <i>C. Malaga</i>; yet, by 6 that evening, we
had a stiff gale for half-an-hour. At 8 we came to anchor
before <i>Malaga</i>, in 14 fathom water. Next morning, about
ten, we went on shore and hosted with Signor Carlos, an
Irishman.</p>

<p>The first thing we went to see was the <i>Major Domo</i>, or
great Church. It is, to the best of my remembrance, in a
manner, round, <i>Scalop’t</i>, as it were, on the sides into 6 or
7 hollow moldings, like vast great <i>niches</i>; and in every one
was an Altar for private Masse.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The Cupola is hang’d
upon rows of pillars, set in a round likwise, so as we may
walk conveniently between them and the Entrance into
those round Isles or <i>niches</i>. We were there in the time of
high masse, yet, so long as we were bare-headed, and behaved
ourselves gravely and civilly, we might walk up and
down and se every thing without the least molestation.
One of our company (a young man who had had the misfortune
of too precise an Education), seing we design’d to
go into the <i>Domo</i>, came to me and my brethren (the other
two Chaplaines going for Smyrna and Aleppo), and askt
us whether we were not afraid, and touch’t in conscience,
to go into an <i>Idol Temple</i>, as he cal’d it. I told him I was
of St. Paul’s mind, <i>To me an Idol is nothing</i>. I could myself
freely go into it, if it was an <i>Idol Temple</i>, for God, the
searcher of hearts, knowes that I do not do it to joyn in
their way of worship, but onely to se it and be the better
able to discourse of it as an eye witnesse, and confute
what was really unlawfull in it. But I bad him have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
care; if he had any scruple, I advised him to go home,
which he did. I mention this passage here, because this
young man that was so extremely scrupulous, fell into
great debaucheries afterwards at Smyrna, and at last turn’d
Turk. Let the greatest Saint <i>that thinketh he standeth,
take heed lest he fall</i>.</p>

<p>We thence went to see Sta. Victoria, which is a convent
of <i>Augustines</i>. In their Church are (ἀναθήματα) <i>offerings</i>
hang’d up without number, in memory of deliverances and
miracles wrought by that Saint, which they there call
<i>virgo miraculosissima</i>. Amongst the rest is a small boat of
reeds, cover’d over with a kind <i>of Tarpaulin</i>, about 4 or 5
yards long, in which 7 Christians (after their prayers, I
suppose, to this Saint) escaped from captivity at Algiers
to this port. There hangs up the effigies of a child that
was raised from the dead, and a serpent of great length
(I guest it 4 or 5 yards), which had been destroy’d by
Christians in Africa, and sent hither. There is within (as
in most convents) a fair square court, cloyster’d above and
beneath; in the upper cloyster are the Brethren’s cells, in
the lower the walls are hang’d with pictures, most of them
representing miracles wrought by their saints. One was
how a dish of fry’d fish, by a crosse of the Saint’s finger
(I think it was the founder of their Order), revived, and
leapt down out of the dish as quick as ever they were.
Another was how he supported a stone of 100 tons weight
(that was falling upon him and his attendants) only with
his stick, or, rather, with a bullrush in his hand. My
brother Huntingdon<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and I convers’t with the good Fathers
that went about with us in the Latine, and as any very
remarkable thing occurr’d we interpreted the story in
English to our company. Now it happen’d that one <i>Paulo</i>,
a Greek (who had been in England some time to learn our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
language, in order to be a <i>Turgeman</i><a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> to our nation at
Smyrna), being by, and hearing us recount these miracles,
very indiscreetly broke out into a loud laughter. The
Fathers were very highly and very justly incensed at it,
and we had much adoe to pacify them, and excuse the
folly of the fact. It hath been a warning to me to make
better choyce of my company in such places ever since,
least I might suffer for the men’s rudeness and childish
indiscretion.</p>

<p>Therefore that evening, with more wary friends, we went
and saw (<i>San Domingo</i>) the Convent of the Dominicians.
It was a very fine and sweet place, built much after the
fashion of the former, but much more beautifull and stately.
In the middle of the court was a little garden, enclosed
with a hedge of oranges and lemons, like our codling<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
hedges; in the quarters stood small orange and lemon
trees, and pots of several very pleasant greens. Santering
up and down, we walk’t into the Upper Cloyster; and
seeing a door and entry open into a fair room, where
somebody was talking, one of our company, who spoke
Spanish, ventur’d boldly in, but sodainly made a profer to
retire, as being mistaken. It happen’d to be a very
Reverend Father’s lodging, who presently stept out to us
and accepted our apologyes as being strangers, and not
knowing our way out. He earnestly invited us in and
gave us a noble treat of sweetmeats and fruits, and several
sorts of wine. He afterwards caryed us down into a large
garden, and bad us gather what oranges and lemons, and
what fruits and flowers we pleased, and at last brought us
out to the gate, where, with all decent respect, and many
thanks for his extraordinary courtesy and civility, we took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
our leave. He had in his chamber very many excellent
pictures; one was of Christ taken from the Crosse, which
he valued at 3,000 dollars; besides the admirable painting,
I took especiall notice of the unusuall manner of the head,
the face being roundish, the hair being flaxen, or inclined
to yellow, and the beard short and curl’d round about the

<p>Next morning, Oct. 15, an ingenious Gaille man<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> (one
Mr. Jolly) and I, by chance were standing by one of the
gates of the City towards the Sea, and talking of the
strength of the Town. I happen’d to say that gate seem’d
so decay’d and crazy, as surely it could not well be
moved without falling to pieces. There stood a man
just by us in mean habit (but dressed in all things like a
Spaniard) who, in as good English as we could speak, said,
<i>Yes, Sir, I assure you it is shut every night and opened every
morning, as you may guesse by the Hinges</i>; which were
then almost worn away. We were not a little surprised,
and we made this reflection in ourselves upon it, that
Strangers ought to be very carefull what they talk in their
own language in other Countryes before them whome
they know not, for they may be better understood then
they think for, and easily entrapt or involved in difficultyes
beyond what they intended or imagin’d. However, it
happen’d otherwise with us now, for, talking farther with
him, he proved an high man who was maryed and lived in
Town; he was extreamly civil to us, and offer’d to show us
what we had not yet seen of the City. We accepted the
favour, and with him we went to several Nunneryes, where,
instead of dull, mopish, vapour’d women, or grave precise
matrons, as we expected, we found as pleasant, bright,
and airy ladyes as ever I met with all elsewhere in all my
life. Their particular chat is not worth the recounting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
but it was extreamely gentile, merry, and diverting. We
past for Captaines (I suppose our Interpreter had named
us so), and they beg’d of us every where for some cheese,
or butter, or Holland, or thin stuffs. We always stick to
one answer, assuring them that we had no provisions to
spare, for we put into that port on purpose to buy some;
we were laden only with Tin and Lead for Turkey, and
some cloth which was not our own. They offer’d us many
fine works and several sorts of sweetmeats to sale; we
bought some which were very admirably well done. My
Lord Baltimore<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> had then a daughter in one of these
Nunneryes which we saw (I think it was at <i>San Bernado</i>);
she was but a girl, and placed there onely for education,
and undoubtedly (setting religion aside) it is a way of
breeding infinitely beyond all our English Schools. A
very lovely sister there beg’d a silver pick-tooth and case
of me, and return’d me for it a pretty little picture of the
V. M., curiously wrought, all with coloured straw. Platonic
love is here very much esteem’d and practised, and really
I have that charity and Justice to believe it may be done
with perfect innocence. In one place we found a jolly
Friar talking at the grate with the Sisters, who, with great
civility, retired so soon as we came in. Once, as we were
sitting by them, in came a surly, stately Don, very richly
attired; and after a profound reverence towards the Ladys,
and a kind of a scornfull nod to us, he lean’d his head to
the wall by the side of the grate, and with his armes and
leggs acrosse, and his eyes fixt upon one of them (which
was very ingenious, but not handsome), he stood thare in
such a fixed posture as, had it not been sometimes for a
sneaking silly sigh (true or feign’d, I know not), you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
would have thought he rather saw Medusa’s head then his
dear Dulcinea’s face. He spoil’d all our mirth; all was
hush’d, and after a decent pause we left him to his
<i>Devotions</i>. He askt our Interpreter whether we were
Catholics; he answered Yes, and all past very well.</p>

<p>One of our English Merchants there (of good repute,
though I shall not vouch the truth of his story), hearing
me recount this adventure, told us that about 7 or 8 years
before, soon after his first coming to Malaga, he had got
acquainted with a young Sister, and often waited upon
her, as well to divert himself as to perfect his Spanish
Tounge; for there at the grate you have all the newes
that is stirring, and the best and most refined language.
He by degrees was wheedled into such fondnesse, as the
presents which he had at several times made her came in
a short time to about 40 lb. He found (being but a young
beginner) that his trade would not bear so expensive
a diversion, where upon his visits were more seldome, and
his presents very few and meane, and at last he came no
more at her at all, nor answer’d one line, though he received
many most passionate ones from her, and there had past
many such (as the manner is) betwixt them before. Not
long after, he was one evening set upon by a Rogue
(which she had hired), and was desperately wounded, and
narrowly escaped with his life. The <i>Rufian</i> soon after
confest it, being himself mortally wounded and taken in
such another enterprise. And here I cannot omit another
story of our worthy Captain. About 8 or 10 yeares since, he
had great concernes with a wealthy Spaniard, a merchant
of this City, and very much kindnesse past between them,
insomuch as they call’d brothers, and Captain Hill lay on
shoar at his house and was freely treated there, sometimes
for many dayes together. It happen’d that another Spaniard
(a neighbour who often came thither, and was of both their
familiar acquaintance), being a great <i>Bigot</i>, and very zealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for the Roman way of worship, often made attempts upon
our Captain to make him a Prosolyte; and there being
once some great Festivall and a solemne procession to be
made, he desired our Friend to be there, adding that he
doubted not in the least that he would then yield and be
convinced of all his errors. The Captain, having appointed
either some business or some other recreation,
civilly excused himself, and thank’t him for his kindnesse
and good wishes. It so fell out in the procession that, as
they were carrying the Image of the V. M. on men’s
shoulders in Triumph (as their manner is on such occasions),
either by the stumbling of the bearers or some
other miscarriage, over she tumbled, and fell down directly
on her face upon the stones. At night all three met to
sup at the merchant’s house, and immediately this zealot
accosted the captain: “O, Sir, had you been here to-day
at the procession to have seen the many miracles which
were wrought, I am sure you could no longer have resisted
the truth; such a blind man received his sight, and
such a deaf woman recover’d her hearing, and a poor
neighbour of ours, that hath gon with crutches to my
knowledge these many yeares, threw them away, and leap’t
and walk’t as well as I can do.” Our Captaine, who had
heard of the Ladye’s misfortune, reply’d: “Surely, Sir, it
is a wonder indeed that the B. V. cured the Deaf and the
Lame and the Blind; I heard she fell down and broke her
own Nose. I pray, can you tell whether she cured that or
no?” The Bigot, at this gibe, fell into such a rage, as
nothing at first would serve turne but the poor Heretique
must go into the Inquisition; and neither former
friendship nor Interest nor persuasion could prevayl of
a good while to pacyfy him. The good Merchant himself
(the common friend), being not a little offended, though it
was spoken onely in merriment, and under (<i>the Rose</i>, as we
say) the freedome and protection of his own house. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
nice a thing it is in some countrys to jest or meddle with
the publick Religion.</p>

<p>There is a Nunnery here (as I remember, it is call’d
San Joseph) where young infants are received and brought
up: Poor people that are not well able to provide for their
children, or others who have Bastards, secretly bring them
in the night, and, pulling a bell to give notice, they lay
them in a moving kind of <i>hollow Roller</i> placed in the wall
on purpose, and so turn them in, themselves who bring
them being unseen and undiscovered. If the child be
baptised, the name is noted or written upon the breast,
and oftentimes mention is made of some peculiar mark
made by nature or Art somewhere on the body, by which
they may be known again; and there is also a register
kept in the convent of all that are so brought in. In my
opinion it is a very great peice of charity to allow such
places, though at first thought they may indeed seem
a kind of encouragement for lew’d persons more securely
to commit wickednesse; yet, undoubtedly, they save the
lives of many poor innocent Babes. I have met with
those who have ventur’d to say, that if a poor Votaresse
there, or any where else in Town, should by chance steal
a taste of forbidden pleasure, the Fruits of her frailty and
the honour of the Society are this way secured; but
I always look’t upon this as a satyrical conjecture rather
then a known truth.</p>

<p>The Spaniard’s common diet in Malaga, such as it is, is
extraordinarily cheap. We took my landlord’s dinner the
first day, which was a large <i>ensalada</i> or sallet, a pottage of
onyons, gourds, and herbs; a little fry’d fish, dryed and
cold, with oyl; <i>mala infana</i> (which they call here <i>Melongenas</i>),
a sort of gourd, pear-fashioned, some as big as my
fist (I think Gerard calls them in English <i>mad-apples</i><a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>), split<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and fil’d with a little pepper, oil, and salt, and then broil’d
or stew’d: these, thus drest, they count rich food, and they
slice them also into their pottage. Of these and such stuff
eight of us eat what we could, and paid but a <i>Real</i> (about
6<i>d.</i>) for all, besides bread and wine; but at night, for
4 fowles and a neck of mutton stew’d, six of us paid
a dollar and half apiece, besides wine, which is near 50
Shillings of our money; and next day, at dinner, for one
joynt of mutton and a little forequarter of Lamb and two
foules, 12 of us paid a dollar a piece, besides wine, which
is about 3 lb. English.</p>

<p>We staid one night with mine Host on shoar, and we
had a proud fellow which entertain’d us a while with
a song or two to a <i>Guitarra</i>. He first lay’d by his old
threadbare cloak with great deliberation and wonderfull
gravity; then, with his dagger behind and his hat cock’t,
his eyes staring, his browes bent, and his <i>Mostachos</i> new
brush’t, he yell’d and acted with that strange state and
fiercenesse, as if he had been swaggering at some desperate
criminals and threatening to hang them; but, with a <i>Real</i>
or two we came off well enough. After supper and a little
chat we thought of our lodgings. All that lay on twills
and bedsteads were sorely bitten with little bugs, which
left hard knobs and pimples wherever they seised. I, with
one or two more, had the fortune to putt our twills for
coolnesse into the middle of the floor, which (as all above
stairs as well as those below are) was laid with brick, and
we escaped all these pestilent companions. These insects,
so well known in all hot countryes (but to us never seen
before), are here called <i>chismes</i> and <i>chinches</i>, and in Italian
<i>cimici</i>, from the Latin <i>cimex</i>, in French <i>punaises</i>; they are
shaped much like a spider, but far lesse, with six legges
and a bottled<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> breech, the back being often reddish. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
are truly cal’d by <i>Pliny</i><a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> most nasty animals, for besides
their venomous bite they have (especially if they are
bruised) a most intolerable filthy smel. One of our comrades,
catching one in the night as it was preying upon
him, and thinking it had been a flea (after a slovingly
custome which he had got), bit <i>it with his teeth, thinking so
to kill it</i>; but the abominable stink set him on vomiting in
such a manner as he verily thought he had been poyson’d;
which make me amazed how they came to be prescribed
inwardly by the antients as a medicine against feavers,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
unlesse it was that (after the Italian proverbe, <i>Un Diavolo
scaccia il altro</i>) <i>one devil drives out another</i>; but, perhaps,
being drunk in wine, they may go down whole, and not
prove so nauseous. We started a controversy, whether
these <i>chinches</i> and fleas, and gnats (and flyes) have any
smeling or no, and we concluded clearly in the affirmative,
not only because these never stir out of their holes and
lurking-places till the steam and perspiration of your
bodyes invite them, but because all strong smels drive
them away, as the savour of wormwood, Lavender, Rue,
Hemp, Hops, Russia Leather, and the like, and the smoke
of these and such other strong smelling herbs doth the
same. And we were told here that many use the <i>Squilla</i>
or <i>Sea Onyon</i>, cut into pieces, and thrust into the joynts
and crevices of their bedsteads, or strew’d on their mats;
as likewise they presse out the juyce of them, and use it in
like manner. It is manifest that the fierce <i>effluviums</i> of
these things very grievously affect these vermin, and seeing
they all have eyes, why may they not as well have organs
of smelling, or something <i>Analogous</i> to it?</p>

<p><i>Malaga</i> is prettily well fortifyed for fear of surprise from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the Moors; it hath two Castles—one upon the side of a
hill, and the other at the bottom of it on the East side of
the Town; and there is a communication between them
both, made by two walls reaching from one to the other;
but there appears a higher place, which, if it was possest
and planted with canon, could command them both. There
is also an Arsenal, but what store of armes and warlike
provisions were in either this or them I know not, for we
were told we should not be permitted to se them, and
therefore never attempted it. It is a part where most
vessels going to or coming from the <i>Levant</i> put in. There
is a great trade driven there; it is famous for Almonds,
Raisins, Oile, great olives, and rich Sack. The grapes
which make the Raisin are very fat and fleshy, affording
nothing near so much juyce as those that make the Sack,
and therefore they are the sooner dry’d by the Sun. We
tasted their old wines in many places, and to my palate
they seem’d all much more fulsome and sweet than our old
<i>Malagas</i> in England, which have had the advantage of the
Sea to refine and harden them. We brought good store of
the best we could find on board, with plenty of all sorts of
fruits and fresh provisions.</p>

<p>That night, Saturday, Oct. 15, about 11 o’clock, we
weigh’d Anchor, and Capt. Pool, in another man of warre,
came out of port with us. I think he was in the <i>Guernsey</i>
frigot. Next day the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and several
Commanders came on board and din’d with us.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 27</i> we dined on board <i>the Martin</i>, and our Admiral
gave us new orders in case we should be engaged to fight
with any Enemies, and that evening we discouered thre
ships with white ensigns, which proved French, of <i>Monsieur
Martells</i> Squadron, lying about <i>Tunis</i> and <i>Tripoly</i>. The
French Admiral himself was in one.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 29</i>, Saturday, we lay on the South end of Sardinia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with Epulo<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> N.E. b. N., 10 or 12 miles distant from us.
The Admiral that Evening call’d a Council of all our
Commanders, and told them he had orders from the Duke
of York to go to <i>Tunis</i> and stay some time there; That he
had a letter for the King of <i>Tunis</i> from our King about
continuing our league and peace with him, For at that
time we had peace with <i>Tunis</i>, but war with <i>Argieres</i>; the
<i>French</i> on the contrary had peace with <i>Argieres</i> and war
with <i>Tunis</i>, and we had a current report that Sir Tho.
Allen and <i>Monsieur Martel</i>, the French Admiral, had
agreed to let English ships of Merchandize go freely into
<i>Tunis</i>, and French Merchant Ships into <i>Argieres</i>, provided
they caryed no provisions, or ammunition, or stores for
war. We had met thre French men of war, and we understood
two more lay near <i>Tunis</i> to block up that Port.
From all this arose a grand dispute amongst the commanders,
whether it was safe for us to go into <i>Tunis</i> or not.
Whether we should hazard such a prize as all our Merchant
ships were. It was urged that there might be more French
ships there than we knew of, and it was uncertain what
they might do with us. That the <i>Tunesas</i> might break
with us upon such an opportunity as this, and seize our
ships and Merchandize. Some dowbted that the Admiral
had no such order, and it was thought when we dined on
board <i>the Martin</i> (who was bound for <i>Tunis</i>) that the
Captain of her contracted with our Admiral to se him safe
in, and so all was mere pretence and fiction. Some
question’d whether the Admiral could command us to
attend him; others, whether by their <i>Charter party</i> with the
Turkey company they were not obliged to ply their voyage
and accompany the convoy no farther than it consisted
with their safety. It was asked who could justify the
agreement between <i>Sir Tho. Allen</i> and <i>Monsieur Martel</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and many such <i>quæres</i> and difficulties were banded to and
fro; but at last the Admiral positively resolved to stand
by his order, and our Capt. and all the Commanders of
our Turkey ships agreed to go in with him except Capt.
Partridge, who was as stifly set against it; and, returning
on board his own ship, he divulged the whole businesse
amongst his passengers, adding all the aggravations of our
danger, and suggesting all the arguments of Fear he could
to them. Presently came many on board us sorely
frighted, and zealously opposed our going in, insomuch as
the two new Treasurers of the Turkey Company (then
going out, one to <i>Smyrna</i>, and the other to <i>Aleppo</i>)
threatened to enter into a protestation with Capt. Partridge
against the Admiral’s proceedings, and courted us to joyn
with them. We civilly denyed it, telling them that we
trusted in the known prudence and careful conduct of our
own Captain, and should cheerfully go along with him
wherever he caryed us. However, all this while these
disputes were kept, as much as possible, from the common
seamen, for fear there should have arose a Faction among
them likewise; yet secretly all commanders were thinking
of some preparation against the worst, and that night we
shaped our course for <i>Tunis</i>, steering S.E. ½ S. Next
morning, Oct. 30, about nine o’clock, we spied the two
<i>Frenchmen</i> of war, just upon the Coast of <i>Africk</i>, as we
thought, setting out of <i>Porto Farina</i>; they stood towards
us a little, then went westerly, and never came near us by
7 or 8 leagues. We bore away directly for <i>Tunis</i>, and
upon this all the rest of our ships in company went along
with us; and that afternoon at 2 o’clock we got under
<i>Cape Carthage</i>, where all the Commanders went on board
the Admiral, and soon were agreed and well pleased; and
at 3 we came all to anchor before <i>Tunis</i> castle, in 4 and 5
fathom water, the Cape lying N.N.E., the Castle W. b. S.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Capt. 5.—Our Stay at Tunis and Carthage.</span></h4>

<p>That night we went on shoar for water, but were not
then permitted to have any; yet we might freely ramble
upon the shoare. The Castle seems very strong to the
Sea. We were not suffer’d to view the other side to the
Land. By the Castle they have several pools or ponds of
standing water, one of which (as we were told) can, at
pleasure, have communication with the sea. These are full
of fish. We bought good store of Mullet, and there we had
one true <i>Bream</i>, large and very fat. We had them very
cheap, as we thought, but our Interpreter counted them
dear. There were several sorts of fruit brought to us—excellent
melons, Pomegranates, Limes, and <i>salating</i>
herbes, with which we stock’t ourselves, and so came again
on board. Next morning (Oct. 31) we went on shoar at
the watering-place, where were come down many country
people with Eggs, Hens, Sheep, Goats, Bullocks, milk,
Pompions, Fish, Pigeons, citrons, Dates, Oranges, Lemons,
and Limes (which are a sort of <i>hedge</i> or <i>crab</i> Lemmons),
with whose juice our Seamen make their punch. There
was also store of bread to be bought. They make some of
it of pure good wheat, most of it of <i>millet</i>, some of what we
call Turkish wheat (maize), much of barley flour, and <i>lighten</i>
it with leaven of salt and sower’d honey and oil, which give
it a brackish taste, yet it is not unpleasant whilst it is new.
They bake it flat, with a rising in the middle like a coppled<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
cake. Every ship stored themselves from hence with what
they wanted of sea provisions. Our Capt. caried a net on
shoar, which by all our Seamen was called a <i>Sain</i> (I suppose
from σαγλιὸν, <i>Sagena</i>, Math. xiii, 47). It was a sort of
drag net. Having obtained leave, we turned it twice or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
thrice in the sea, but we catch’t few fish, and those very
small ones. They wer <i>Mullet</i>, <i>Barboni</i>, and our common
<i>plaice</i>, and a little sort of what we call <i>Maids</i>. I hang’d a
little <i>Barboni</i> up in my cabin, and it gave forth a little thin
light, like that of rotten wood, for many nights together;
and by degrees, as it grew dryer, it at last vanish’t. I did
not then take notice of the change of colour in them (whilst
they are dying) which <i>Pliny</i><a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> mentions, and for admiring of
which <i>Seneca</i><a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> rebukes and flouts at some Romish gluttons.</p>

<p>Some of our Captaines and Passengers with me hired a
couple of their Janisaryes, or rather souldjers, to be our
Guides, and away we went together to see the Ruines of
<i>Carthage</i>, which reach quite from the watering-place near
the Castle up beyond <i>Cape Carthage</i>, agreable to what we
read in Polybius,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> near upon ten miles as we guest, but
the guides said it was fifteen, which may seem probable
enough, for <i>Strabo</i><a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> makes the old City only to have been
in compasse thre hundred and sixty <i>stadia</i>, which is five
and fourty miles, at eight <i>stadia</i> to a mile; yet Livy<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
makes it not much above half as much. And the ground
lay in hills and dales, so as we could by no means make
any tolerable judgement. Of from the shore, for a mile together,
the Land was then sown with Barley, but all that
ground is so full of small rubbish as a man can hardly set
his foot upon cleer Earth; <i>Jam seges est ubi magna stetit
Carthago</i>. We went first by the sea side, where they make
Salt by letting in the Sea Water in Summer into broad
shallow flats, and, after the Sun hath exhaled the moisture,
the Salt remains in great panes behind. We saw great
quantities of it here and there heapt up, which they told us
was for the <i>Grand Signor</i>. Whether they have the art to
refine it, or whether they send this coarse (<i>bay</i>) salt (as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
call it) to him, I did not think to enquire. However, I
find in <i>Pliny</i><a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> that, of old, the Africans made great quantities
of salt upon this coast, about <i>Utica</i>, now call’d <i>Biserta</i>,
which is not above thirty miles from hence to the west,
just on the other side the River <i>Bograda</i>. These men may
as well now be said to make <i>Hills of salt</i> as those were
then, and I believe it is altogether as <i>dry and hard</i> as that
was. Perhaps some of that which we cal’d common salt at
Constantinople came from hence. We were informed by
our Guides, who spoke broken <i>Italian</i> and <i>lingua Franca</i>
(which is bastard Spanish, mixt with words of most trading
nations), that from <i>Cape Carthage</i> to the Castle was
once <i>Terra firma</i>, full of rubbish as the rest now is, but by
an Earthquake it sunk down. It is very likely, or perhaps
the foundations of the city were laid in the Sea, for we
saw from the shore many broken pieces of walls and
ruines of buildings under water; and our Seamen, in
Haling the <i>sain</i>, found the bottome very foul ground a
good way from the Shore into the Sea. Along by the
sea side remain at land many, many Vaults, some cover’d
in part, some all over, some quite open. In summer,
people come down from several places, and keep shop
here. The hardnesse of the mortar in these and other
remains is very remarkable; a stone will very hardly break
it, yet it is not fine, but the sand, or red earth, intermixt, is
very grosse, and full of small pebbles. One Vault, a little
distant from the shore, seem’d to go far under the ground.
We could see in about a furlong, but did not go in far because
we wanted lights. It was crosse-arched to a row of
pillars in the middle. I fancy’d it might have been part
of the stables underground for Elephants, which Strabo<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
saies went in the neck, or <i>Isthmus</i>, from Sea to Sea, sixty
<i>stadia</i>, or about seven miles. We found, now, great quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of bones of Foules and other little creatures in
it, and it smelt strong, so as we believed it now to be
a receptacle or den for foxes or wolves, or such beasts
of prey.</p>

<p>We went thence up from the sea towards the middle of
the Ruines. All the way there remaines pieces of walls
and buildings, but not one pillar or stone of any note.
There lye heaps of rubbish so thick that it is impossible to
plough in that part, unlesse they removed it, which would
be at most as tedious a piece of work as to rebuild it.
There was amongst the rubbish much Alabaster, Marble
of all sorts (white, Black, Red, streaked red and white,
white and black, and the like), a sort of red stone, porish,
but much harder then brick. We observed not one Flint,
no sort of Free-stone, very little brick, onely in one side
going up to <i>Cape Carthage</i> all was brick, and nothing
else, but not one whole one nor half one was to be found.
The earth at a distance shews red with the crumbled and
scatter’d pieces. There was also much white brick, extream
hard. In one place we found small pieces of Porphyry,
and some thin flat bits (like broken pavements) of
blackish marble spotted with green, like a sort of what we
call <i>serpentine stone</i>. I am more particular in this point,
that we may from hence have some guesse at the Beauty
and Majesty of this City when it was standing in its Glory,
for if our houses in London shew so well, being all built
with plain brick, what would they have done had they
been all of various Marble?</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>At last we came up to a place which our Guides and
our Seaman call’d <i>Queen Dido’s Tomb</i>. We all concluded
at first that these were the Elephant Stables so much talkt
of by old Authors, but at last I chang’d my opinion, and
do now verily think that they were onely cisternes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
keeping of water, as Tunis<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> is also now supply’d by such
cisternes. We were told that farther up towards <i>Cape
Carthage</i> there are more considerable mines, and finer
things to be seen; but there was a <i>Mosque</i> there, and
several houses about it, where we were informed many
<i>Dervises</i> or holy men lived, and that it was dangerous
going amongst them. Leo Africanus makes them very
great, but we were not near enough to judge anything
of their Grandeur. However, I and another happened to
straggle a little that way from our company, and one of
our guides threw down his mantle and his staf, and would
not stir till we came back; for he said his head would go
for it if we should commit any error, or come by any
harme through his neglect, so he hallow’d us backward,
and we obey’d. It seems sometimes there are streight Arabs
(<i>i.e.</i>, Arabs from the Straits) lye lurking about, not far off
from the shore, who, if they can conveniently snap any
stranger, they will spirit him away and sell him for a
Slave; so that upon all accounts I think it was very well
that our curiosity carried us no farther that way.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>When we were come on board, we design’d next morning
to go and see <i>Tunis</i>, but this unhappy accident disappointed
us. Most of our <i>malcontents</i>, before mentioned,
went thither in the morning when we went to Carthage.
We had no Factory there, but onely an English Consul to
do all our business, whose name then was Mr. Earlesman.
They waited upon him and embroyl’d him with their story.
Our Admiral had wrote to him the night before to invite
him to dinner that day, but the letter chanced to pass
through some of their hands, and came not to him till
past ten o’clock, being then delivered by one of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
The Consul (whether upon this account, or whether he
staid to entertain them, I know not) staid at home, and
returned no answer to the Admiral, who staid dinner for
him, and at last was disappointed in his design’d treat.
About eight at night the Consul came to him to excuse
himself, but the whole matter was so ill-resented by the
Admiral, as he resolved to weigh Anchor that night. The
Consul urged that the <i>Martin</i> (the ship which the Admiral
was so earnest to bring in there) was almost unladen (for all
our ships’ crews helpt him with their long bootes), and would
infallibly be ready to go with us by twelve the next day,
being bound for Zant. But the Admirall thought himself
too much neglected; first, because the Consul came not of
his own accord to wait upon him; next, because he came
not when kindly sent for; so, in a heat and a hurry, we
were all forced to weigh Anchor that night about eleven
o’clock. Several, perhaps, that staid at Tunis all night,
were left behind. <i>Paulo</i>, the Greek, with whom we were
embroyl’d at Malaga, was one, and one of the Admiral’s
passengers was another, being an Armenian Bishop, who
had studyed sometime in Italy, and now went home as a
Roman <i>Emissary</i> or <i>Seminary</i>. All our Ship’s company
were, by good fortune, on board, and we came away together.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Capt. 6th.—Our Passage from Tunis to Cervi.</span></h4>

<p>We had newes at <i>Tunis</i> that twelve Algerine men of
war were gon to the Eastward; some designing for the
<i>Archipelago</i>, others for <i>Rhodes</i>, <i>Cyprus</i>, and those parts
towards the end of the Mediterranean. This made our
whole fleet keep company together, and for this reason the
Consul was more earnest that the Admiral should take the
<i>Martin</i> away with him, but it was left behind. Notwithstanding
this ruffle between the Admiral and Consul, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the Consul went of (which was about nine or ten at night)
he was complimented with nine guns, being in that station
the King’s representative.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 7th.</i> At two o’clock the Admiral call’d all the commanders
on board to a consult, and the next day we dined
all on board the Assurance.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 8th.</i> Tuesday, when we were past <i>Zant</i> (having
<i>C. Matapan</i> to the E. about eight leagues, and <i>Sapienza</i>
about ten to the N.), about five after noon we saw a <i>spout</i>
to the Northward. We had most dismal turbulent weather
for thre whole dayes and nights, and a constant rain, with
most dreadful thunder and Lightning almost all the time.
The dry weather which we had till now had so <i>parch’d</i> the
wast<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> of the ship and the upper timburs, and made all
above so leaking, as I could not keep my cabin dry; one
night I was soundly wet as I lay on my bed. I was informed
that it was very usuall to have such tempestuous
weather hereabouts at this time of the year; and our captain
told us that in <i>Zant</i> earthquakes are very frequent,
that he hath known twelve in a week. That the people in
summer almost all leave their houses and live abroad till
winter. That on the west side, far from the Sea, is a
mountain that spues forth a sort of <i>petroleum</i>, or Bituminous
Lime, as black as soot, and it will grow hard and look like
it, which was not unknown to Pliny.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> This issues out on
the <i>East side</i> of the mountain, and flames alwayes arose
plentifully when the <i>west</i> wind blowes, and hath then a
stronger smell then at other times.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Nov. 9th.</i> The Sailors that had been on the
watch told me that in the night, after the storme was over,
they had seen two little <i>Lights</i>, one at the foremast top,
the other hanging upon one of the <i>main stayes</i>. They
call’d them <i>Corposans</i>; I suppose from <i>Corpo Santo</i>, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
<i>Italians</i> name them, believing them to be the Ghosts of
some saints who come to relieve them. But our men would
hardly be persuaded but that they were not some <i>Hobgoblins</i>
or <i>Fairies</i>, or the inchanted Bodyes of witches, and
we had many a fine story told to that purpose. The
Heathens of old when they saw but one named it <i>Helena</i>,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
when two, both, that is, <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i>; why they were
then made the Seamen’s Tutelar Gods or saints you may
see at large in <i>Natalis Comes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and determine whether the
antient or modern superstition is more justyfiable. Our
seamen assur’d us that in many voyages to the <i>Indyes</i> and
elsewhere they have seen sometimes six or seven together
(sometimes many more parted or splintr’d into small globulor
sparks, like pills), and <i>hanging as it were</i> on the <i>yards</i>
and sails, or upon the masts, but most commonly aloft,
which makes me adde this one reason to what <i>Carles</i><a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> hath
given us why so many sometimes appear together in our
dayes, whereas not above thre at most (and that most
rarely) are mentioned as ever seen together by the antients,
viz.: as our Ships are bigger, and of more ballast and burthen,
so their masts and yards and riggings are caryed
much higher, and by consequence more of that unctious
gleam, which after the dissolution of the clouds and ceasing
of the Tempest remains dispersed in the Air, and affords
<i>matter</i> for these <i>Meteors</i>, is rather aloft than nearer to the
Hull of the ship, and so is more plentifully met with all by
the upper rigging and tackles, and cleaves to them. And
asking farther about this point, they told me these <i>lights</i>
are oftner seen and more together upon a tall ship then
upon a <i>pinnace</i> or small vessel.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> I was not a little displeased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
with our seamen who were on the watch that night,
because they did not call me; whereupon the next night
(Nov. 9) they did call me, for after very much Thunder and
Lightning and tempestuous weather, about four o’clock
appear’d two more, one towards the <i>main top</i>, which disappeared
before I got out, the other was at the very top of
the fore-mast. They told me it was beginning to fade. It
seem’d a dim light, as of a flame, shining through a steam
or smoak,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> about the bignesse and shape of an ordinary
egge, the top a little wavered, and growing fainter and
lesser it soon went out. When I came back into the great
<i>Cabin</i>, there appear’d a Circle about the candle which stood
on the Table; I would call it rather a <i>Halo</i>, because it was
very little coloured. The farther we were from it the
plainer it appear’d and bigger (almost as broad as both my
hands); as we came nearer to it it lessen’d proportionably,
and just at it we could not perceive it, all which depended
on the various refractions through the moist and mixt
vapours which then fill’d the Air. One of our <i>Mates</i> told
me that once, as he sailed formerly in these <i>streights</i>, there
appear’d a very bright Helena at the very <i>spindle</i> of the
<i>main top mast</i>, and one of their men went up and moved
his hand round about, and neither saw nor felt anything,
when they below saw it all the time. We sent up one to
ours, but before he got at it it went out; perhaps his
approaching might move and part the Air, and contribute
something to its so soon vanishing. But if what our Mate
told us be true, it requires more consideration than I
thought fit to afford it at that time, unlesse I had seen the
like.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 10.</i> <i>Cape St. John</i> (or the west end of Candia) lay in
sight of us S.E., and the Admiral came about ten o’clock
on board us to take his leave. After two houres stay he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
went of, and we gave him seven guns, the three last with
shot, as a token of more respect. His Ship answer’d again
with great civility. <i>Capt. Partridge</i>, with the <i>Turkey Merchant</i>
(whether he had not yet fully digested his discontent
about our going into <i>Tunis</i>, or whether it was the natural
rugged temper of the man, I know not), sailed away before
the Admiral, for <i>Scanderoon</i>, without taking any civil
leave, or firing one gun. We remained now but seven in
company: six Turkey Merchant Men and Capt. <i>Wild</i> in
<i>the Assurance</i>, our Convoy and Admiral. After <i>Capt.
Robinson</i> and <i>Capt. Partridge</i> were gon, <i>Capt. Wild</i> came
to dine with us, and as we were set newes was brought in
by one of our <i>powder monkey’s</i> from the Top Mast head
that there were five great ships <i>a Head</i>, coming <i>stem for
stem</i> towards us. We all concluded that they were some
of the Algerines before mention’d, therefore Capt. Wild
immediately returned to his Ship, and gave the signal to
the whole fleet to make ready to engage them. At the <i>top
mast</i> head, with a glasse, I made seven of them, there being
two small vessells besides the first five. It was pleasure to
se the great alacrity and readinesse, I may say the eagernesse,
of our Seamen in preparing for the dispute. All
their Hamocks were down in a trice; their chests and lumber
turn’d out into the boates, or stived<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> by the <i>main chains</i>
or elsewhere, out of the way. We had a clear ship in a
very little while, and all our men posted in their several
quarters, and rounds of powder and ball provided by every
gun. Our Captain told me, if I pleased I might go down
into the <i>hold</i>, and be safe there with the Chirurgeon. I
told him if he would give me leave I would rather stand by
him all the while, for I should as heartily and (he need not
doubt) as earnestly pray for our good successe there as any
where else. He thankt me, and told me it would not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
little encourage his men to se me above board. With that
all our Passengers took heart and came and stood with me
upon <i>the quarter deck</i>, where were armes and ammunition
provided for us all. We were to be the second Ship in the
line, and after we had all made a little back till we were all
ready, we bore up bravely to them. But when we came at
them they proved five French men of warre, with one <i>Satée</i><a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
and another small vessell with a <i>meson</i><a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and <i>stay sail</i>,<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> which
I suppose were as <i>Tenders</i>.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> They belong’d to the same
Squadron with those which we saw by <i>Tunis</i> under <i>Monsr.
Martell</i>. One of their Lieutenants went on board our Admirall,
and told him that they came from <i>Toulon</i>, and had
been looking out for <i>Tripoleses</i> and <i>Tuneses</i>, who it seems
had been there abouts six or seven days before. Being
asked, he said the <i>Algerines</i> were about <i>Rhodes</i> and <i>Cyprus</i>.
And thus our <i>scare fight</i> past over, without any blowes.
My Curiosity was fully gratyfied with this Prelude of a
battle, for I believe I could give a shrewd guesse at all the
rest, and that I then thought enough. Though indeed I
did not see the least sign of fear or want of courage in any
one, yet I suppose all of us were well satisfyed and pleased
to sleep that night in a whole skin.</p>

<p>For thre or four dayes the wind was full in our eye; we
tacked and tumbled backwards and forwards between
<i>Cerigo</i> and the W. end of <i>Candia</i>; then we got between
<i>C. Matapan</i> and <i>Cervi</i>; and having been thus beaten up
and down, and made no progresse, and little hopes being
left of a fair wind, by consent we came all to Anchor on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the S.W. side of <i>Cervi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> in nineteen fathom water, about
five o’clock, Nov. 14, afternoon. That evening I went with
the Captain in his pinnace sounding the several depths in
the bay, and then went on board our Admiral, where all
the Captaines resolved to go on shore next morning for
what provisions we could find, especially of wood (whereof
there is plenty), and fresh water if we could find any.
Next morning our Capt. and I and two of our Gentlemen
passengers went on shore in the <i>yale</i><a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> betimes, before any of
the other Commanders appear’d. We landed at a spot
where it was plain ground and an open place, and therefore
free from <i>Ambuscades</i>. Immediately came down an old
Greek from the top of the mountain in a poor patch’t
habit, in a thick coarse jacket, a woollen shirt, with no
stockings nor shoes, but onely some pieces of a raw hide of
an oxe or bull wer laced<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> on to the soales of his feet with
the hair side inwards, which I suppose never go of till time
and rottennesse separate them. With these his feet are so
plyable that he can easily go up or down a rock which our
shoes will not suffer us to do, at least with that dexterity.
Old Hesiod was born not very far from hence, and I
thought we had had one of his old acquaintance risen from
the dead and come to us, his <i>coat</i> and <i>socks</i> and <i>shirt</i> being
exactly in his Boetian fashion. He had a skul cap on,
border’d with a Lambskin, which he pull’d off, and came
boldly to us. We had a native Greek in our boates crew,
and he was our Interpreter, for I spoke as good school
Greek to him as I could in our pronunciation, but my
language seem’d as perfect gibberish to him as his did to
me. We askt for Flesh: Sheep, bullocks, goates, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
like. He told us they were all driven of the Island the
day before, for they took us for <i>Africans</i> and Enemyes,
seing us lying so long upon their coast. We askt for
water. He told us there was none but what was preserved
from the rain in hollow basins in the Rocks, which he
directed us to; and I afterwards tasted of it, and found it
good. There are no people who continually live there, but
they come from the continent to till the ground, which lyes
on the edges of the mountain round by the Sea, and had
good corn then growing on it; they likewise bring sheep
and other cattel sometimes from the main land to feed
here. We asked him if he could procure any cattel or
other necessaryes to be brought over for our money. He
said he would go and informe his friends, and see what he
could do; he doubted not but we might have something;
in the meantime he shew us where we might try for water.
He answer’d all along with such a show of innocent simplicity
as we were much pleased with him; and I gave him
a Tunbridge knife which I had in my pocket, and everyone
likewise gave him something, which he received with a
wonderfull submissive reverence, and promising us a very
grateful returne of our kindnesse, away he went, running
directly up the mountain. By this time all the other
Commanders (except Capt. Wild) and a great many of
their men were come on shore. Most of them brought fire
Armes with them, and in all we might then make about a
hundred Firelocks. All the Captaines strictly commanded
their men not to stir far from the shore; and our Captain,
to make us more wary, told us that in the year (as I
remember) 1664 our general ships passing by here for
Turkey came to an Anchor, and many went on shore on
the mainland there, whereof thre worthy merchants and
six or seven others were snapt by the natives, who lay in
wait for them, and it cost them 1,600 dollars for their redemption.
The Turkes call that part of <i>Peloponnesus</i> (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
well as all Thrace) <i>Romania</i>; and from that word (by an
<i>Aphaeresis</i>) these wicked people are called <i>Maniotes</i> (as the
inhabitants of <i>Smyrna</i>, <i>Scio</i>, <i>Cyprus</i>, <i>Candia</i>, are called
<i>Smyrniotes</i>, <i>Sciotes</i>, <i>Cypriotes</i>, <i>Candiotes</i>, and the like elsewhere).
These who live upon the Rocks and mountaines
by the Sea are a sort of lawlesse people, and the Turkes
themselves cannot govern them or reduce them into any
good order. These miscreant wretches lye constantly
watching upon the Rocks and Mountaines, not so much to
secure themselves from the injuryes of Pirates as themselves
to Thieve and rob whome they can catch, and all
the Christian Passengers which they can seise on the shore
they sell to the Turkes to serve in their Galleys or otherwise
as slaves; and I have been assured that if they can
conveniently <i>spirit</i> away Turkes themselves they will serve
even them in like manner, and sell them for slaves to any
Christian who will be their chapman.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> There was a fawning
cunning <i>varlet</i> came to those Gentlemen then, and pretended
to procure them all manner of provisions which
they could desire, but betray’d them then, as this vile
wretch did us now. I could not but call to mind old
<i>Sinon</i> in Virgil,<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> for our <i>Cheat</i> seem’d to pretend to the
very same motto: <i>Poor, but very honest</i>. Believe me,
Greeks are Greeks still; for falsenesse and treachery they
still deserve <i>Iphigenia’s</i> character of them in Euripides,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
<i>Trust them and hang them</i>, or rather hang them first
for sureness. We kept in little bodys near the shore,
where there were small thickits of Juniper and mirtles
with their berrys then ripe, and we had excellent
sport in killing <i>Fieldfares</i> and <i>Thrushes</i>, and such
other birds, which were there at feed in great abundance.
Some went towards the Sandhills, where was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
store of game in little plashes made by the sea-water,
which was cast in there by winds and stormes. After we
had sported our selves a while with shooting in these
thickets and Plashes,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> two or thre of our Commanders invited
me to a Collation, and as we were set in the shade
under some pieces of rocks, we saw several of our men
(notwithstanding all the Captaine’s commands, and our
Captaine’s History) struggling up the Mountain. One was
habited something like our Captain, and, at a distance,
appear’d indeed to be him; whereupon some Gentlemen
coming by us would by all meanes have tempted my
Curiosity to have follow’d them, but our Captaine’s lecture
at our coming on shore had stir’d up such wary apprehensions
and jealous reflections in my mind, as I could not
possibly be persuaded that it was he; and the Captaines
there with me were in a very great rage to see such inconsiderate
people running into that danger. No sooner had
these gentlemen left us but we hear’d thre or four guns go
of upon the Mountain; and, looking up, we saw some of
the Straglers posting down in wonderful haste; and presently
appear’d several Men brandishing their <i>cutlasses</i> or
<i>Cimitars</i>, and making them glitter against the Sun. We
immediately rose, and went to the body of our Company
to hear what was the matter. It happen’d that five or six
gentlemen had got some seamen with them, and away they
had ventur’d up the mountain. The Gentlemen (I know
not whether it was by good Fortune or Policy) were
hindermost, and just as their Vanguard was got on the
brow of the other side the Mountain, up rose about a dozen
Rogues, who had layn sculking there in the thickets, and
ran upon them. They being scatter’d abroad, and not
near one another by fourty or fifty yards or more, at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
surprise fired upon the Rogues without doing any execution
(perhaps most of them were charg’d only with small
shot). So soon as their fire was over, the Rogues came
more boldly on, though armed onely with half Pikes and
<i>Cutlasses</i>. Our Seamen, who had not in the least considered
to make good their retreat, threw down their Armes,
and betook themselves to their heels. But our gentlemen
had the start of them, and so, God be thanked, these all
escaped, though very narrowly, all coming down without
their Armes, most without their Hats, some with but a
piece of a Shoe, their feet and leggs being battered and
torne, and their bodyes bruised with rushing through the
Shrubs and jumping down præcipices, for they came right
forward, thinking the shortest way was best. Four of the
poor Seamen were taken—two of the <i>Mary and Martha’s</i>
men, one of the <i>Levant Merchant</i>, and a fourth of the
<i>Tho. and Francis</i>, whome they first had slightly wounded
in the face, then they seised him and tyed his hands behind
him, and left him with thre Rogues to guard him. These
drove him before them, and because he often linger’d and
offer’d to stop, they pricked him forward in the back, and
wounded him in several places with their half pikes. The
poor man was a very stout fellow and a good wrastler, and
feeling the thing which bound his hands something loose,
slipt his right hand out, and, with great courage and presence
of mind, turn’d upon the Rogues, who were uselesse,
and thought they had him safe. With this advantage, he
ran the first quite over, and struck up the heels of the
second; the third (who was a little behind the other) made
a blow at him with his <i>Cimitar</i>, which he saved from his
head with his lefte arme, and lay’d hold of the weapon
with his right hand. The Rogue, drawing it a little back,
cut the poor fellow’s hand badly. Yet this saved him
from a second stroke, for he being something under the
Rogue, he struck him up <i>hand and foot</i>, and before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
other two could come at him, away he came. The great
concerne which he had for his dear life and dearer liberty
added something more then natural vigour to his leggs,
and as much lightnesse to his heels. At last he got to us,
and told us all that had past. There were, in another
place, two of our seamen (one the native Greek) who made
a very soldjere-like retreat. As they straggled from us,
they kept together, and, out of a thicket, up start five or six
<i>Maniotes</i>, and made towards them. They, standing together,
presented their Muskets (resolving not to fire but to
good purpose, and therefore not till they were very near).
Down the Rogues dropt again. The Seamen retreated;
they again follow’d. The Seamen presented again, and they
again squatted down. Our Greek at last spoke to them, and
told them to <i>keep of</i> in their own language; at which
they stopt, and so these two retired leasurely and safely to
us. After some debate what we ought to do, we all in a
body were marching up the mountain to rescue our men;
but <i>Captain Wild</i>, being all this while on board, and observing
all which had happened, thought we were not
strong enough; and, therefore, firing a great shot over us,
call’d us back; and sometime after came all his soldiers on
shore well armed; and then Mr. Day (his Lieutenant), a
brave stout man, marshall’d us all, and put us in order:
and away he led us up the mountain. But when we
arrived, we saw we were come too late; for all the Rogues
had crost the water in their bootes, and were just landing
on the Main, and with our glasses we could discover our
poor Captives amongst them, bound. The Lieutenant
was earnest for bringing our boates about and going to
them, for they appear’d in all much short of a hundred
men. Our Captaines, though all brave men, were utterly
against that, for being, by their Charter-party, bound to
ply their Voyage, they could not tell how they could
answer such an adventure, for we knew not what event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
our landing on the main land in a Hostile manner might
produce, so some of them came back presently; but the
Lieutenant and the rest rambled all over the Island, where
they saw not one man left, nor found so much as one
house. Here and there were Coves, in which they found
some tatter’d cloths, and a few poor utensils; as likewise a
sack of meal, and good store of onions and such-like very
mean booty. I hardly believe that this <i>Maniotes</i> do ever
bring any cattle hither (though our honest <i>Sinon</i> told us
they did), or, at least, they feed them on the other side the
Mountain, and not in view, for fear of <i>African</i> or other
Pirates, who would sweep them of. They onely come
here to till the ground and reape the corne, and now and
then to make such <i>Ambuscades</i> as these; and very slender
provisions will serve them upon these occasions. Some of
our men, as they march’t, found some Hats, swords, pistols,
and such like (it seems uselesse) baggage, which our first
<i>Myrmidons</i> had discreetly scattered in their retreat. At
last all came down, and we went on board, much lamenting
our sad misfortunes, and all concluded that if we had proceeded
on at our first march, and not staid for Captain
<i>Wild’s</i> souldiers, we had certainly rescued our men, and
perhaps sufficiently chastised those Sons of Belial. After
some little conference with all the Captaines, we joyntly
agreed to contribute to their ransome, and everyone setting
down their good will, we had that night subscribed about
1,500 dollars, the poorest seaman giving one. Next morning
the Admiral sent out his boat, and we went in ours
with white flags of Truce round the Island, but not one
man appeared to treat with us, or to take the least notice
of us. Wherefore the money was collected and deposited
in the Consul’s hands at <i>Smyrna</i>, and, about two yeares
after, the poor slaves were found in the galleys and redeemed,
though they proved most ungrateful wretches, for
I heard that when they got into England they offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
sue their Captains for their wages, which they pretended
was due to them for all that time.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cap. 7.—Our Passage to Smyrna.</span></h4>

<p><i>Nov. 17.</i> At noon we weigh’d Anchor, and with the
wind at S.S.E. and S.E. we turn’d out between <i>Cerigo</i> and
<i>C. St. Angelo</i>. Next day being entered the <i>Arches</i>,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> we
staid for the <i>Levant Merchant</i>, and dined there.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 19, Saturday.</i> We had very much rain all the day,
and all the following night. The wind to E. to S.E., we
got nothing of our way, but with much ado we kept <i>our
own</i>. This ill weather continued for the most part till
Nov. 21 about noon. That Evening we saw 4 sail in
<i>Argentiera</i><a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> bay, one with a flag at the <i>Topmast head</i>. We
could not tell who they were; if friends, we had no reason
to fear them; if foes, they certainly feared us. We past
between <i>Milo</i> and <i>Antimilo</i>; between <i>Serfon</i> and <i>Sifanto</i><a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>;
between <i>Tino</i> and <i>Micono</i>; between <i>Scio</i> and <i>Ipsera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> And
Nov. 23, in the morning, we got past <i>C. Calaberro</i>
(or, as our seamen call it, <i>C. Tobbernose</i>), from the true
Turkish word <i>Caraburnes</i><a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> (<i>black nose</i> or black <i>snout</i>),
<i>where mill stones were cut out</i>, so call’d, I suppose, from
the black rock out of which they were taken. And if
there be yet such <i>a black</i> quarry there, I should conclude
that the Turkes also nam’d it <i>black Nose</i> from thence.
We went on with a fair gale at W.N.W., but the Admiral
and <i>the Speedwell</i> running more in to the shore, was
becalm’d and left <i>a stern</i>. At 2 afternoon we came up to
<i>the Castle</i>, where lay without the port of <i>Smyrna</i> two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<i>Holland men of war</i>. We saluted the Admiral with thre
guns, and he return’d us thre. Our English Merchants
came on board us, and at five o’clock we came to Anchor
at <i>Smyrna</i>, and saluted the Port with seven guns. I went
on shore, and lay at Mr. James Adderley and Mr. Nath.
Thurston and Mr. Jon. Prideaux their house, where I was
most courteously and nobly entertained. The <i>Assurance</i>
staid without the Castle, and the <i>Speedwell</i> came not in
till the next day. None of our men of war must go into
any of the Turkish Ports so far as to be commanded by
any of their Castles. It seems that the Turks formerly
have been very insolent, and have laid an <i>Imbargo</i> or
Arest upon some of our men of war which were in Port,
and, as I have been told, have made use of them in the
last <i>Candia</i> Warre; to prevent which inconvenience for the
future, our men of war alwayes lye without the Castles.
And several French men of war in my time came up to
Constantinople, and lay at Anchor there sometime, and
great embroil was like to have happened thereupon about
a Knight of Malta who escaped, of which more elsewhere.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Capt. 8.—What happened whilst our Ships staid
at Smyrna, and our Journey to Ephesus.</span></h4>

<p>Rambling about the Town, one of our passengers, who
had lived at Smyrna before, caryed me to a rich Turkes
house, who was one of his old acquaintance. I think they
call’d him <i>Eusine Chabbey</i>, a very courteous man, and
friendly to all our Nation. They told me that he once
invited them all at the <i>cutting</i> or circumcision of one of his
sons, and treated them very generously. We found him at
Supper, and he very earnestly prest us to sit down, which
we did, <i>Taylor like</i>, crosse leg’d, for we saw neither chair
nor stool, nor anything else but the floor cover’d with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
carpets. We tasted of his cheer, which was good, plain,
wholesome food. All things being so quite different from
our own way of living did very much surprise me with
wonder and delight. But of Turkish entertainments and
other customes I shall give a large account more conveniently
elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Novemb. 26.</i> Our Consul, the worthy Sir Paul Ricaut,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
treated us at his country house, which was six or seven
miles out of Town, in a village called <i>Sedjagui</i>; I was
told the right Turkish name is <i>Seghiahkioi</i>, as much
as <i>Strangeham</i>. It seems the word <i>Kioi</i> in Turkish signifies
a <i>Hamlet</i> or Village, and therefore it is made the
termination of country villages very frequently, as our <i>ham</i>
is in English names, and it is pronounced something near
the work <i>qui</i>, so in <i>Bailgradqui</i>, <i>Hosqui</i>, <i>Ortaqui</i>, and
infinite more everywhere. Several of our nation have
likewise houses of retirement there, as also the Dutch Consul,
<i>Jaques von Dam</i>, and others of that nation then had.
It is a very pleasant and convenient place for divertisement,
especially in summer. I took much notice of an
old <i>Coffe</i> man there, who was an <i>Afionjè</i> (or Ophiunjè), <i>a
great eater of Opium</i>. He seem’d much above 60 yeares
old, and told us that in a morning till he had taken
a little dose, as much as a half nut or more, he had no
strength to get up, or to raise or turne himself in his bed;
but after it, he had vigour, briskness enough to do anything.
He was very lean, the flesh, or rather the skin of
his cheeks, hanging like Spanish leather; and he had very
oft (almost every minute) a strange kind of <i>spasme</i> in the
muscles of his breast, or a jerking motion like those who
have a strong Hickock.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 30.</i> Some of this generous Factory designing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
accompany several gentlemen, their friends (which now
came from England), to Ephesus, were pleased to admit
me into their <i>caravan</i>, and my very kind friends where I
lodged accoutred me and furnisht me out with their own
Janisary and everything necessary for that Journey. We
were, in all, about two or three and twenty, all very well
provided with horses and armes. That night we lay at a
country town, call’d by our Europeans <i>Jamovasy</i>, but I am
told its true Turkish name was <i>Jaman bakgia</i>, or <i>bachi</i>,
that is, <i>terrible garden</i>; it is about four miles beyond
<i>Sedjaqui</i>. It is a pretty large town with several <i>Moscheas</i>
in it, which are all shaded with tall Cypruses and some
pines, whose verdure at some distance seems very stately
and very pleasant. From thence we went through a plain
for six or eight miles somewhat wet or moorish (which, I
suppose, might happen from the rains falling on either
side from the mountains, and staying there, where it was
but narrow). It was spread with <i>Agnus castus</i> in great
plenty, which I have often observed to love such a moist
soil; there was nothing then on the boughs but their seed,
which was very good, and of a stronger smell then that
with us. Next we came to firme sandy ground, fill’d
with Oakes (without any underwood), like some of our
parks. They were all short, snoggy trees, much loaded
with boughs; I saw not one good piece of Timber
amongst them. Then we ascended a rocky mountain, not
continued smooth at top, but broken into many and deep
dales, for the most part cover’d with several sorts of
middle-sized trees, with shrubs amongst them; the way
both going up and going down was <i>filled with loose stones,
being very difficult</i>, yet our horses had been used to such
places, and caryed us very safely on. This road is very
dangerous by reason of Thieves, who lurk in the thickets
and dens that are upon it. Many people lay buryed here
and there who had been murdered and slain, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
bones of men lay scattered above ground. We often saw
several people at a distance peeping at us, and one came
and joyn’d himself with us for a mile or two, and then
stole away from us; we thought it was for no good end,
but we were too numerous and strong for them to venture
on us. This mountain is now called <i>Aliman</i>, and all our
former Travaylers take it for the Antient <i>Mimas</i>, and my
good friend Dr. Pickering<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> would needs have the very
word <i>Aliman</i> jumbled from <i>Almiman</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Capt. 10.—Our Departure from Smyrna.</span></h4>

<p>At last, <i>Dec. 22, Thursday</i>, about eleven in the morning,
we weigh’d Anchor with a fair gale at S.E.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Dec. 24.</i> In the morning I had a little Aguish
distemper: I fancy’d that I had gotten cold with overheating
myself in wading and labouring upon the sand-bank
the last day we were there a shooting. The wind blew
very hard most part of the day at N.N.E., and we had a
very boysterous Sea. We split our Fore sail, and it almost
blew away: we had stood in close under <i>Lesbos</i> all night,
and that day, about four o’clock in the afternoon, we came
to Anchor before <i>Tenedos</i>, in ten fathome water. Soon
after, we sent our purser a shoar to wait on the <i>Aga</i>, who,
by him, invited us to come and take what Provisions we
wanted. He sent us some fish; amongst the rest <i>Sea
Breme</i> (as our Capt. call’d them), with a large, very sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
prickly fin all along the back, and some fish which feel’d
rough, like perches, with two prickly fins on their back,
and on either side they had just eleven streaks or laces
fore and aft (to use the seaman’s phrase), parallel to one
another from the back downwards, of a bright <i>gold colour</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Agá</i> beg’d some glasse bottles of our Capt., which
were sent to him next day by our Purser, who went a
shore and bought all the provisions which we wanted, and
with them good store of white Muscadine, a rich, sweet,
heavy wine. I was so ill as I durst not venture out, but
shall hereafter give you an account of what I observed
when I came there a second time.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 27, Tuesday.</i> About five in the morning we weighed
Anchor, and by eleven o’clock following we were at the
mouth of the <i>Hellespont.</i></p>

<p>A little beyond the innermost castles of old <i>Sistos</i> and
<i>Abydos</i>, on the Southern Shore, lyes a little sand bank,
which reaches on round about a sharp point of land directly
opposite to <i>Magla</i> (antiently <i>Madgla</i>). Our second Mate,
being on the watch, kept the south side of the Stream
(which continually set out here to the West), for the advantage
of the Eddy and the easier passage on that west
side of the point; but, bearing in too near the South Shore,
about two o’clock, ran our ship on ground. We had but
one easy gale, just enough to stem the current, and the
sand and mud at the bottome were soft, so we were in no
great danger, and, carrying out an Anchor a sterne (as is
usuall in such cases) with the Winlace, we soon wrought
the ship of again, and so plying our voyage, by five
o’clock we safely doubled the point, and got sea room
enough.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 28, Wednesday.</i> About ten in the morning we came
to an Anchor before <i>Galliopoli</i> (the Greeks still call it by
the old name <i>Callipolis</i>) in 20 fathom water. We stay’d
not above two houres, and then weigh’d again for <i>Constantinople</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
where, on Saturday, Dec. 31, at thre in the afternoon,
we came to Anchor at the custome house on <i>Galata</i>
side, having saluted the Seraglio as we past by with 11
guns.</p>

<p>I went immediately up to my Ld. Ambassador, <i>Sr. Dan.
Harvey</i>, and deliver’d those letters of consequence which I
thought not fit to venture with others by the common
<i>messo</i> from Smyrna; and, the next day being New Yeares
Day, I entred upon my employment.</p>

<p>When I went to get my books and other things on
shore, the Customes ript open my Trunkes and boxes, and
searched and rifled every thing. However, at last I mist
nothing but <i>Niceron’s Thaumaturgus opticus</i>, which I
shrewdly suspect was filch’t from me by one who was indeed
call’d a Christian, but had not, it seems, the honesty
of a common Turk.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Extracts from the General Diary extending
over the whole of Dr. Covel’s Residence
in Turkey.</span></h4>

<p><i>Aug. 15th, 1671.</i> ’Tis observ’d by the Greeks as the feast
of Assumpt. B.V.M. with great solemnity. They all repair
to Church, Men and Women apart. Masse is mumbled
over. The priest does not consecrate a wafer or a whole
loaf, but cuts a long square cut about ¾ of an inch broad;
with his nail he makes a crosse on it. After the prayer of
consecration he elevates it, and they adore; then there is
the discourse from the Patriarch. After masse the Priest
comes out with holy Water in a pot, a crosse, and an aspergillum
of hyssop, or lime, or rosemary, or what he can get
green (that at the holy fountain was Basil), and Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
bread on a dish. By use in the Greek Church none are to
eat or drink till they cut it. Everyone comes up towards
that place in order: first the Men, then Women. He gives
them a piece of bread, ζυμὸς, leaven’d (it is as that for the
Eucharist), and he holds the Cross for the kisses; he
washes them on the face; they lay down their aspers,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
and depart. Those that have paines in their head or are ill
come to the Priest, and lean down their head (Men and
Women), on which he layes his book, and reads some
piece of the Gospell; they present aspers for that. All
being done, there is brought to the Church doore a charger
of boyld wheat, cover’d over with crosses made of blancht
almonds and raisins; everyone that will takes one of it, but
is obliged to say a Pater Noster and Ave for the souls of
the dead there buried. Masse is said in the same manner.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 8th, 1674.</i> I was at the consecration of the new
patriarch Dionysius, Archbishop of Larissa (or Metropolite).<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Parthenius had brought out Methodius, and disoblig’d
the greatest part of the Greek Metropolitans; they
joyned against him, bring him out, and get him banish’t
and sent to the Pasha of Cyprus. Mathias, with all the
Metropolites and thre ex-patriarchs, were in the sacristia;
it being ended, out comes the ex-patriarchs with their
pastoral staffs in their hands. They are prettily coloured,
like your gaudy tobacco-pipes with globular joynts, the
crosse or handle at top, two serpents’ heads, yellow like
gold. First was Παίσιος, second Διονύσιος, third our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Μεθόδιος; and took their seats on the left of the quire (as
you enter) just over against the Patriarch’s seat, which is
like a chair with 4 steps up to it, a tilt like a flat pulpit
over it, supported with a back behind, and two little posts
before. They sat in their order, Παίσιος uppermost, next
the Sacristia, and then followed all the Metropolites, and
took their places on the patriarchs’ side from his seat
towards the door in order. Then in a Pulpit high on the
wall of the ex-patriarch’s side an officer of the Church (I
suppose their λογοθέτης)<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> read a long declaration against
Parthenius to justify their proceedings, wherein he made
him the veryest Rogue in the world, calling him διάβολος
κακοῦργος, τῶν δαιμόνων δούλος, etc., and at the end he pronounced
him ἀφωριομἐνος, ἀνάθεμα τρισκαταραμὲνος, at
which the ex-patriarchs and all the Metropolites, wagging
their heads, cryed out aloud ἀνὰθεμὰ τον, many of the
latter thrice repeating of it with vehemency. The French
Embassador, and we Franks and many Greeks could not
but smile. My Dragoman (a Greek) told me that if this
one be turned out, and Parthenius restored, the other
faction will anathematise him as much, and they served
Methodius just soe. Then Παίσιος read a formall instrument,
wherein he personally agreed to the censure; the
like did the other two <i>ex parte</i>, and all the Metropolites,
all ending with ἀνὰθεμὰ τον. Then they proceeded to
another part of their service, in which the new patriarch
(another Διονύσιος) had a short part, which he said in
sight of all at the door within the sacristia, where he
was all the time. After it (half way in the choir, just
against the Patriarch’s seat) another officer of the Church
(which is the μεγάλη ἐκκλησία, a grand chiesa), I suppose
him the μέγας ῥήτωρ, mounted on a <i>scabellum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> 1½<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
foot high, made a very handsome speech in his commendation,
pronounct it very plain and gracefully. He
insisted upon a parallel between their hopes now and
their former calamyties, though touch’t but lightly upon
Parthenius, I suppose for fear of his returne. He complimented
the Metropolites and expatr. (ex-patriarchs) with
the presage of future happiness, and their good choyce
he commended, etc. The new Patriarch all the while
lookt humbly down to the ground. After it, he returned
a short and modest answer. Next came up toward the
Sacristia (above the Orator a great deal) the Bishop of
Heraclea, with a pastorall staff, and, holding it in his hand,
made another pretty compliment, partly to the New
Patriarch, partly (turning about) to the company, and then,
going up to him, presented it to him, and kist his hand.
Then he on his left hand, and another on his right, lead
him along to his seat. In the midway, the ex-Patriarchs,
rising from their seats, met him and kist him (<i>alla graeca,
del un ed altro omero</i><a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>), then return’d to their seats; he
goes on to his. Then come all the Metropolites, pass in
order, and kiss his hand; returning to their seats immediately,
they passe on towards high masse. The Gospels
are bound very rich in Embroidery gold and silver, and have
the crosse on the side, which, as it was brought back from
the pulpit (in which it was read), the patr., ex-patr., and
the French Embassad. kist. The host, before it is consecrated,
is brought through the body of the Church, at
which all the Patr., expat., Papa., etc., uncover their heads
(and come downe), which at other times is cover’d with a
black knit kind of Monmouth with eares, and a kind of
course listany hood over it, which they put of and on upon
many occasions. Before consecration and elevation, all
adore to the ground, the patriarch, expat., etc. Masse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
being fully ended, a Metropolite went up and preach’t 1st
a very short prayer, then name his text Mat. 5-8, καθάρτατος,
then saluted the Patr., expat., Metropolit., and the
whole auditory, return’d to his text again, where the
greatest part was reckoning up various opinions. He
quoted Ignatius, etc., etc., and coming to speak of Parthenius,
calling him bad enough, [amo]ngst the rest comparing
him to Lucifer and the bad angels; he mistook,
and said Παίσιος (who was there present, and hang’d down
his head). Then we many cry’d out, <i>Parthenius, Parthenius</i>,
at which he making a stand, said Παρθένιος λὲγω,
and with much adoe went on. He ended his sermon
with a short prayer. The greater part of his sermon was
much about Parthenius’s abusing the Church. At the
door of the Church lay many thousands of candles, which
were given by Greekes and others. First, before the New
Patr. came from the Sacristia to his seat, every one lighted
his candle, which made a brave sight from end to end of
the church. Just as the New Patriarch took his seat, all
cryed out (again and again repeating) ἄξιος, ἄξιος, ἄξιος.</p>

<p>After the Sermon was done, the Patriarch took down a
small crosse (guilt with gold) that hang’d behind, and,
holding it, he blest people (as he did once or twice in the
office before with his hand, they all bowing at the same
time). Then came out the <i>pane Benedetto</i>, and was carried
to him. All the people came (thronging), kist his hand,
and took some bread. The <i>Aqua benedetta</i> was not
brought forth, as I saw. The French Ambassador invited
me to dinner with him, as likewise to the Patriarch’s House,
but I excused myself, etc.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 21.</i> we went (my Ld., etc.) to the Islands. We
did not touch at any till we came to Principe.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 23</i>, I was much indisposed; the 26th I fell ill of a
continued feaver, which held me 17 dayes. I lost above
30 oz. of blood, reduc’t me so low that (it being a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
cold season) after my feaver left me I had much adoe to
retain heat in my limbs; my right thigh was perfectly
numb from my knee to my hip, but friction, and bathing,
and flannel on my own head set me right. Dr. Alexander
Maurocordato came (by D.’s kindness); he advised me, 1st,
to eat flesh and goe colder in my very feaver. I a little
inclined to his advice, but one poringer of strong broth
increast it strangely, and I got a cold that I could not quit
in 4 days. 2dly, he advis’d bleeding in the <i>salvatella</i><a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> (I
starv’d my feaver out, eating nothing for 5 or 6 dayes, but
dinner and supper, one little porringer of Eng. Gruell).
3dly, when I was out of my feaver, which he cal’d a
miracle, he advis’d me to beer, forbad me all wine upon
pain of relaps. I drank beer at dinner, found my stomach
windy; at 6 o’clock I drank again with a tost, but it gave
me a most intolerable fit of griping in my stomach, which,
with vomiting, I got away in 3 houres. I recovered so
well as to go to Chappell.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 7th, 1667</i>, came a young priest—he wrote down his
name himself, D. Hilarione Bubuli—to me from padre Jeremiah,
to know if any letters were for Venice from my Ld.,
me, etc.; amongst other discourse he made a great discovery
to me. He was a Basilian (a Greek), but in orders (by Rome)
a Venetian, born and bred under the Greek Arch Bp. there.
He was not inform’d well by Padre Jeremiah (who is a
Greek of another stamp), and, taking me for a Romanist,
told me there were many Metropolites now Romans in
their hearts, and that some money would do anything
amongst them; they question’d not but shortly to make
Metropolites enough of their own way. He said this
Patriarch was a lay man, cropt hair bare, but by money
and friends he was made a deacon one day, a priest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
next; a Bp. and metropolite of Larissa the third. The
design was this: they underhand by mediation of the K.
of France and his Embass. here, the Emperour and his
resident at Adrianople, the Bailo of Venice, first calumniate
the Present Patriarch, and are now plotting his removal.
Next day they have here (now obscurely) the Metropolite
of Paros and Naxia, who they designe shortly for Metropolite
of Ephesus, a true man in his heart to them; next to
make him Patriarch. The businesse is committed to the
Italian Archbp. now at the new church (St. Francesco):
he told me the Jesuits and the Capuchins know of it, and
he knew I would be secret, too; he said Padre Jeremiah
was ignorant of it wholly, though he knew him wel
affected. I mentioned Panagiotes at Court; he said he
was not acquainted with it, nor must be, but he had a very
great kindnesse for this Metropolite, and he himself has
copied out all their letters of late correspondency, and he
will be ready to make him Patriarch they question not;
his name was D. Hilarione Bubuli, as you may see his
own hand on the first whole leaf of this book. He said
the Greek and Latin Church differ in 5 things; 1st, the
Holy Ghost; 2nd, The leaven’d bread in the Sacrament;
3d, Purgatory; 4, The Pope’s supremacy; 5, The forme of
Baptisme. He said they had all their services in Greek,
but Romanized.</p>

<p>The Turkes at Biram, and at all victoryes and births of
the princes, make great mirth. It happen’d the Sultana
was deliver’d of a second son this last Ramas, Decemb.
1673. The mirth was put of till the Biram, and then
it was doubled; all were mad for 3 nights and three dayes,
every shop open and drest up with laurell flowers, etc.,
many candle machines with pretty figures, puppet playes,
dancing, etc.; the Janisary’s chambers was the finest
sight. Almost in every shop was 1, 2, or more of these
old mysticall figures of health. Whether it is of any
meaning among them, or only taken up by chance, I
could not be informed. In many of them was a sphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of 2 or three circles; if it signify anything of antient
superstition, it must be endlesse or everlasting health.</p>

<h4>1674.</h4>

<p><i>Jan. 6th.</i> Usually about 12 tide, beastly boisterous
weather; few vessels at sea. 20th, we were kindly entertained
at the Dervises; they play’d to us; the old supravisor
beat the Tambur (the antient Tympanum); their tones
were very passionate; the rest devoutly attentive. Many
of them have a great 6 or 8 square Agat (with a hole in
the middle) at their girdle. He (whome I ask’t about
it) told me that stone foretold the sicknesse of their
friends by growing pale on the edges, and their death by
growing pale towards the hole in the middle; he said
it sweats against poison, etc. I remember two Kalenderis
aboard the Viner had each such a one; they had the caps
of a wandring Dervise, but in all things else like the habit
of the Kalenderi, in Mr. Ricaut, he makes them Santons,
but in good earnest they are meer Tomes of Bedlam.
One had a horne tyed about his shoulders (like a wild
goates, but longer); he blew it like our sow gelders, high
to low. He had a great hand jar, a terrible crab-tree
truncheon, a leather kind of petticoat about his middle,
naked above and beneath. It was then in May or June.
He had a course Arnout Jamurluck.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> He drank wine (like

<h4><span class="smcap">Voyage to Smyrna with Sir Daniel Harvey’s Body,
who died Aug. 28th, 1673.</span></h4>

<p><i>Apr. 10, 1674.</i> At 8 at night we weigh’d (being upon
the Dogger), and next day 3½ in afternoon we came to
Anchor at the Asia side over against the little conduit
within shot of that most innermost castle. We went
on shoar and dispatcht our business with the Aga there.
My Ld. had sent each of them a vest of cloth; we had
our audience without the castle, in a house on purpose,
by the draw bridge. Our Jew Druggerman, 10 or 12
dayes before, had shew’d some strangers up and down
without the Castle, and at last, venturing to peep in, was
catch’t and soundly drubb’d. Notwithstanding this, I went
round about the outside and past it.</p>

<p>Several guns on the ground play up and down the
Hellespont; on that side are 14 port holes, where lye great
guns chamber’d to shoot stone shot, very big, near 2 foot
diameter, all fixt and immovable, and therefore to be
charged only without. They will fling a shot crosse the
Hellespont with ease. In the night they have lights on
either side, and watch if any ship steals down; just as they
eclips those lights, they can see them and so fire upon
them. Bellonius makes it but ¼ mile over; it is near a
mile at least. I was not on the other side Castle, but I
counted just 23 gun holes and thre sally ports between
them; it seem’d a farre bigger castle than Abidos above said.</p>

<p>12. By reason of our present, with leave, we weigh’d at
10 o’clock, and within lesse then an houre we passt the
other outward castles, but at too great a distance to say
any more then that they are fairer and greater, and built
according to modern formes. At night we reacht the N.
end of Mitilene about 8 o’clock.</p>

<p>14. At 4½ in the morning within sight of the Centurion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and Smyrna Castle. At 10 we anchor’d, and went on
board. Capt. Wild thence to the Advice frigot (then there
in port), thence to Smyrna.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i> Put my dear Lord Harvey’s body on board the
<i>Centurion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The great Cabin was hang’d and the floor
cover’d with mourning; round about were fasten’d scutchions;
the Steerage was hang’d likewise. My Lord’s
body was taken of the Dogger into the Centurion’s long
boat, there cover’d with a rich velvet Pal, bordered with
white Sarsenet and satin. At the Head of the Corps was
fixt a Hatchment, my Lord’s armes, in a square frame
standing on one of the corners. At the head of the boat
was his six trumpeters and his drummer. The Advise’s
long boat tow’d it forward, and in it was his 6 Trumpeters
likewise, and his drum, all sounding a dead march, went
slowly forward in a round; the Consul’s (Mr. Ricaut’s)
boat followed; after that many of the festoons in other
boates. At its reception into the Centurion there was 3
voleyes of small shot and 30 Guns fired. The Advice fired
28; all the General ships and others in port fired, some 12,
some 14, some 16 guns. Worthy Capt. Hill, who brought
him out, fired every minute all the while we were going on
the Dogger. The Body was put down into the hold, and
a Cenotaph stood in the great cabbin, cover’d with the pall.
The great Scutcheon displayed at the head six great tapers
burning by in six great silver candlesticks. I gave away
about 40 dwt. weights among the officers of the Centur.,
and sent a cask of 19 Meters of wine among the Seamen.
We din’d aboard, treated civilly. The Consul brought
flasques of Smyrna wine; Mr. Temple brought 20 flasques,
and several fresh provisions. At 6 at night we all returned
to Smyrna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>22. Parted from Mr. Temple’s seate at 21st, midnight, or
towards one o’clock this morn. Got on board the Mary
and Martha by 6. Out of the sandhead, lay becalmed all
that day and night over against the w. end of long Island.</p>

<p><i>29th, Wednesday.</i> Ashoar at Tenedos; gave the Aga of
the Castle 1 oak case.</p>

<p>All the Greeks live the N.E. end of the Town. They
goe in the streets cover’d with a petticoat over their head,
gather’d in to a button above; their gown without a wast,
hang’d on with two latchets on either side, girdle above
their brests. A bullock there for 4½, kil’d, drest, cut out
in the street in ½ an hour. Holy fountain at the N.E. end.
No church, but several Papasses say masse in a little hole
in a stinking house, which the padres make a Tavern
about 8 yards square; the V.M. in a little hole, etc.</p>

<p><i>2, Saturday</i>, came to the custome house by 12 o’clock.
Saluted the Seraglio with 7 guns. Deo laus et gloria ex
grato corde.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p><i>Apr. 1st</i> was Maunday Thursday, to the Greek it is
μεγάλη πέφτη.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> At daybreak the Patriarch washt the
disciples’ feet. A great waxe candle was brought before
him (instead of a mace). He came to his throne in the
ordinary habit. Every Greek (that makes it right) makes his
crosse leisurely, ἐν τῷ ὀνὸμάτα τοῦ πάτρος<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> ✠ (the top of the
brest), καὶ τοῦ ὓιου ✠ (the middle), καὶ τοῦ ἁγίου πνέυ ✠
(on the right above the pap), ματος (on the left above the
pap). All the Metropolites do it very gravely. There were,
1st (next to the preacher’s throne), Heraclea; 2d, Cyzikos;
3d, Νικομέδια; 4th, Chalcedon; 5th, Philippopoli, etc., etc.
The patriarch came to his seat (whilst the choir sang the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Gospel out of St. John 13). Then there were the 12
priests (all maryed), which came two and two, and bow’d
to the ground, and kis’t the patriarch’s hand, retired back,
ador’d again, and retired into the Sacristia. Then all
array’d in priests’ cloathing proper, only upon everyone’s
neck was the apostle wrought in gold, whom they represented.
First came a miserable poor wretch (without a
cape, etc.) to represent Judas; then a good stretch after
followed all the rest, and seated themselves before the
Patriarch, who was at the other end. Then the Patriarch
vested himself in his robes, στοιχάριον,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> with a hole on top
like a surplice with sleeves, body to the ankles; sallow
green (or yellow green) tuffetay, Ὡράριον,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> a broidered tippet,
ἐπιμανίκιον,<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> embroyder’d sleeves (he crosses and kisses
every vestment, and he was putting on this and forgot,
then pul’d it of), ἐπιτρακχὴλιον,<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> embroyder’d kerchief put
about his neck, Ζώνη his girdle (alla turkesa), ὑπογονάτιον,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
a square embroyder’d handkerchief (foot and half square),
with 4 tassels; it hang’d by his right side. Then his 2
deacons help him down (4 staires); he begin with Judas, and
the Third deacon in the pulpit (reading the same Gospel)
repeat to every washing, “He began to wash their feet,”
etc.; he kneels down, and washes the right foot (which only
is bare), his 2 deacons helping him with bason, Ewers, etc.
Whilst the 3d Deacon is in the pulpit reading, he strips
himself of all his robes (the στοιχάριον, ἐπιμανίκιον, ὡράριον,
ὑπογονάτιον), but the ἐπιτρακχὴλιον, and another lose vest,
half slew’d<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> to draw the sleeves (with laces), set with 3 bells
on each side, and two to each corner (likewise when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
vested himself he put of his monkes hood), τὸ ἀνάνω
καμηλαῦχον,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and divel’s cap (as the G. S. cal’d it) τὸ ἔσω
καμηλαῦχον, and put on an embroyder’d crown set with
diamonds and pretious stones, and quarter’d (with 4 glass
diamonds and perls); upon the top a crosse emerald and
sapphire. He puts on a blewish <i>pestemal</i><a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> before him, and
a large Towel over his shoulder, with which, when he has
wash’t the foot, he wipes, then kisses, and the person at
same time kisses his crown. He proceeds (beginning at
Judas) till he come to St. Peter 12; there begins a Dialogue;
the Deacon go on to (Joh. 13); he asks: Lord, will you wash
my feet, etc., the deacon only repeating the passing words;
at last he wash him, too. Imediately all the rabble strive
for the water to dip handkerchiefs in it, and a Greek
answer’d me (as I ask’t) that it must be very pretious after
so many good prayers. This done, the Patriarch returns to
his seat, the deacon leisurely reading the same Gospel
again. He re-vests himself, the 12 rise, and, reverencing 2
by 2, return to the Sacristia; after them the Patriarch,
then there changing his clothes for his ordinary habit, he
returns to his seat, and then the masse begins. When he
went out of the church his 2 deacons bore up his traine, the
candle going before him. He treated me at his lodge with
coffee; invited me to dinner, but Draco and I would not
stay. Many gatherings for Judas<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>; amongst the rest there
were there the 4 treasurers of the Church, ὁὶ ἐπίτροποι τοῦ
παγκυρὶου. There is a great chest, fair and rich, on the right
hand coming in, called the παγκύριον. Draco’s brother-in-Law,
who was at first a furrier, is the chief, worth, by common
report, 600 purses of money (300,000 doll. = 75,000 lb.).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
The Prince of Moldavia owes him 80,000 doll.; Wallachia
as much; the church as much; and every Metropolite
something. He gave a silver broach for candles, worth at
least 500 doll., to μεγάλη ἐκκλησία. He hath taken the debt
of the Church upon himself, covenanting to be continued
4 or 5 year. Over against the Patriarch’s seat are two
other of states just together: the first Moldavia, 2d Walachias;
but they two never meet together, but dispute their
superiority, and therefore alwayes one or both are absent.
The Patriarch, when he blesses the people, or his own vests.,
etc., lays the thumb of his right hand crosse the ring finger,
the fore finger streight, the middle finger bending; the
mystery in it is I.C. X.C.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The people bow to the
ground, then kiss the Patriarch’s hand, then retire backward,
reverance a 2d time, then go away as they goe back;
some tumble over the head of the others bowing behind
them. Before the Patriarch came the priests were anointing
poor slaves, which priests must alwayes be 7 in number,
and pray’d over them. In the masse the bread and wine
are caryed in procession alwayes before they be consecrated;
the Patriarch comes down, and every Metropolite
and all adore low to it as it passe by. When all is done
the bread left upon the <i>prothesis</i><a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> (after the piece for the
Sacrament is taken out as is comonly distributed) was
given by the Patriarch himself, some in their mouths, some
in their hands.</p>

<p><i>Mart. 23rd, 1676.</i> Holy week. I was at the Sermon at
St. Francesco’s; saw Demetrius Simon wash 12 of the
fraternityes feet. The priest reads or sings the Gospell
out of St. John 13, and he rose from his seat at the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
end of the stalls, and put of his vest, put on sackcloth, and
gird himself with a <i>pestemal</i> put before him, and a towel
on his shoulder, came down to the 12, who were sat on two
formes in the chappell just before him, at these words,
“He put water into a basin” (for the priest stayes till he may
be ready), he puts water into a great basin. At those
words, “Lord, not only my feet”, he comes to the first, and
pourring a little water upon his right foot, washes it, wipes
it with his towell on his left shoulder, then signing it with
the crosse, kisses it, and they kisse his hands; this he doth
to everyone, then returne to his stall, and puts off his sackcloth,
and resumes his other clothes. Then they go to
their prayers; a layman sayes and sings most of them;
the Prior or sub-prior gives the benediction.</p>

<p><i>July 17th.</i> There was an old Lady (daughter to a Sultana
of some of the former emperours), commonly now
called Sultana Sporca,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> from her ill manner of life, for she
kept about 30 women slaves of youth and greatest beauty
she could provide, and these were all taught to tumble,
dance, and sing, and act many tricks; and so, often going
abroad to great Bassa’s houses to shew them sport, brought
their old baw’d in a great revenue, every one presenting
them liberally, and what they got she received. Amongst
the rest she was possest of one of the greatest beauty that
then was found (as was said), not onely in the Court,
but the whole Empire, if not the world. When we were
at Adrianople the Grand Signor sent to demand her for
his own use; the Sultana denyed her, saying she had made
her free, and that she could not now be used by them
legally, but as his wife; thus she avoyded the G. Srs.
importunety. Here about 10 dayes since she (continuing
on the dancing trade) with her companions were at a great
Bassa’s house to tumble and play tricks, and the Capitaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the guards to the G. V.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> (who had been with him, and
fought valiantly in all his warres at Candia, etc., and was
become his favourite) chanct to be there; and when the
girl had done, he (which is unusuall for strangers) presented
her 200 zechines, being smitten most desperately
with her, and two dayes after sent to the Sultana, begging
that she might come to his house, and he promised 2,000
zechines reward; they came, and after some houres sport
he sent home all the slaves, but kept her all night, and
next day conveighed her to a friend’s house in Stambal;
she was thre dayes by Mr. Hyet’s house. The Sultana
next morn made Answer to the G. S., telling him that the
girl was really her slave, submitting herself to his mercy
for having cheated him before, saying it was only because
she was then too young for him, but now the captain had
violently ravisht her. The G. S. was as much inflamed on
the other side, partly with remembrance of former love,
partly with madnesse that he lost one so sweet. He
went immediately to the Viz., commanding him to look
into the businesse as his; he cals the Captain, demands
why he had done so, and where she was, etc. He denys all;
says he abused her not, nor knew where she was. He sent
to the Kaimachan of Stambol, and charged him privately to
watch the Captain, etc. In the third night the Kaimachan
took them both about 12 at clock in bed, or on a sofa
together, brought them before the Grand Vizier. The Sultana
(infinitely troubled) sent the Grand Signor word. The
Captain told him she had been at 40 other houses as well
as his, etc.; he was not afraid of death nor the sword (as
he very well knew), and therefore valued not one straw
what became of him; but all that he desired was that his
Mistress should be spared, in whome he should live even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
when he was dead. G. S. sent word immediately to strike
of his head, which was done (he was strangled: Soliman
Basha saw him), and the body lay’d publickly open at the
Tents, with the head under his arme all day (July 18),
being pay day, for all the Janissaryes to behold it. He had
been infinitely beloved by them and all the court, and
2,000 purses of money had been offer’d to save him, but
all impossible; the girl was immediately taken into the
Seraglio. I fancy this was at bottome onely a deep policy of
the Grand Signior’s Vizier, “it is necessary that one die for
the people.” People began to be mutinous and rebellious,
and by the process of the story (for certainly the Vizier
might have hinted something to the Captain when he set the
Kaimachan to catch him, and have advised him to let the
girl be forth coming under hand, making peace with the
Sultana, etc.), some great example was to be made, which
was on the Vizier’s own favourite, etc.; else I must count
it a severe piece of justice upon the Captain, who dare do
that against Law which the G. S. refrained from. The
G. S. kept the law which the Captain dare break, yet he
knew her to be a slave, which the G. S. knew not, and that
might alleviate. The Sultana was punisht as well in
losing her slave and future gain. Or, lastly, we may roll
the exorbitancy of Princes last, who desire to engrosse
all pleasure to themselves. This great Capt.’s death breads
ill blood in many hearts: his good services in the Field of
Mars might have interceded for one spasso (recreation) in
the court of Venus.</p>

<p><i>July 19th.</i> From St. Swithin’s day, 15th, the ayre was
cloudy, and upon this day at even began a mist which
daily increast to that thicknesse as no man could se 300
yards at sea, nor at land (unlesse on the hills) as far again.
It was not a moist mist; it continued vehement till 28th,
then dayly abated. The sun continually rose and set like
blood; most part of this time the wind blew strong, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
is more wonderfull; at other times it carying all mists
away. It lay continually betwixt N.E. and N.W., yet more
to the E., then the W.; all which make one conclude that
this mist was brought and continued from the Palus
Mœotis and Black Sea it self, and gave us a perfect taste
of the Cimmeriæ tenebræ. The 29th and 30th days of
June almost cleare.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p><i>Aug. 24th, ’76.</i> <i>The G. S.’s Tents.</i> I have seen them and
the rest at Adrianople and at Maidan<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> here several times.
He hath but onely the three; the rest are little tents for his
servants’ kitching. I saw the G. Srs. tent at the shew at
Adrianople, which was much the same in make and
dimentions, but this at Maidan being most perfectly set out
with all its appertenances, take its description. First, then,
there was a small stand about 8 foot square within, with a
paire of small staires to mount it, was cover’d with reddish
or inclining to purple cloth, with 4 golden balls at the
corners and one at the top; the corners were to be lifted
up, or, if he desired more fresco, the whole side, as all the
rest could be quite taken away, the cloth being fasten’d
above with loopes and buttons of wood. This Kiosk, or
stand, they remove upon many occasions; he had a farre
greater at Demirdesh<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> to see the horse races. This stood
next the outward door of the tents, looking towards the
place of execution, as likewise to the plain where the
Janissaryes are pay’d, etc., and he is there present himself.
At the sights at Adrianople there was another for the
young prince.</p>

<p>The first tent is square, supported with 7 wood posts one
way and 4 the other way; it was 15 strides long and 12
broad; the roof flat, kept streight with ropes; a large round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
flower in the middle. They have sides for this in cold
weather, which they can open and shut at pleasure; on the
outside upon every post stands a golden ball or flower-pot.
The second tent is round, supported by one standing post
in the middle, with golden ball or pot at the top, by which
there is drawn upon a cord a curtain at pleasure crosse the
tent, on the outside of which he gives audience to his own
ministers of state, or makes his great divan, and sits in
justice; on the in or back side he gives audience to Embassadores,
or the like. The diameter of this tent (that is,
from edge to edge of the fringe that hangs above as the
eaves of an house) was 17 paces; that in Adrianople was
15, so that it is plain they are made of severall bignesses.
The under sides of this likewise were to let down or up,
take on or off, at pleasure, by such kind of loopes above
and on the sides, the button being a piece of wood; the
interstices between, if they were above, were cover’d with a
fring, one within the other; without, if it was on the side
to clasp the curtains together, one was made to lap over
the other, so that they can shut a tent up most exceedingly
close and warme. The third tent is his long tent, supported
with three posts, and golden balls or pots; it was long
(from the eves at one end to the other) 35 paces; at
Adrianople, 37; by putting of it and extending it they may
easily gain or loose a pace or two. At the middle post, to
the outward side, was set a bed or broad couch, bolstered
up at both ends, of twilt or ticking sattin; the coverings,
silk, embroyder’d. At Adrianople it was ten times richer,
with gold and pearls, for without doubt they have alwayes
ready several coverings. The floor on this and the round
tent is covered next the ground with a thick sort of course
Yorkshire or Kidderminster woollen cloth, over which at
severall times they spread carpets, or foot cloths of severall
richnesse and value. At Adrianople I saw it once with
Persian carpets; another time with sattin, embroyder’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
with massy gold, as the floor likewise was where my Lord
had his audience; the bolsters and cushions were suitable.
Behind this was a partition wall made of canvas, the ground
and the flowers of bits of cloth; the covering of all these
tents was on the outside a pale green canvas; on the inside
the ground satten flower’d with bits of divers colours, some
satten, some fine cloth, and all the edges and seems were
wrought with gold and silver twist. All the flowers and
Kiosks, etc., wrought are fancyes not at all according to
nature, and though all together showes very glorious and
stately, yet in the particulars it is very bungling and
blockish. They often bring in round bits of satten or
cloath patch’t one upon the other in their fruits and flowers,
and being of divers colours, represent so many Crescents.
They make likewise the figures of some antick birds, few
beasts, but no men. The panes of the inside are all arch’t
as the wall tents belowe; at bottom a fring as on the side.
The vallance was of the same make, and were of various
sorts and fancyes in several tents of party colours. Passing
through the Partition wall we came to the Gr. Sr. sleeping
tent, or bedchamber, which they call <i>oda</i><a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>; it is square, with
a ridge above like a house, which is supported with two
long posts, four shorter being at the corners under the eves,
which hang over like a pent-house, as the wals which were
made lattice fashion, and richly gilded and painted, with
doors to open on thre sides; it was about 12 or 13 foot
square, for we were not suffer’d to enter neither here nor
at Adrianople. When it is very hot these lattices alone are
used; if it be cold it is wal’d round with red cloth lined
with flower’d damask. We looked in; it is floored in like
manner with the rest, sometimes richer, sometimes not;
there is a bed stand crosse the door at upper end, bolster’d
at each end; the bed stood plain, but they can set it out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with severall adornments. Upon a settle or little stand by
lay the Al Koran and a whimsicall coat of a great Santon<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
dervish, which was all cover’d with green silk; this was
not there at Adrianople. The santones coat I saw taken
out about ten dayes after; it was like a <i>Taberd</i>.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> There
are therefore three courts, as it were, all invironed with a
wall tent, embattled like the walls of a City, which none
else can have but himself; the flowers and corners are red
canvas, the lists of white girt web, the ground green canvas;
all in this fashion, but 4 have some severall fantasyes in
some suits, which are not in other suits; yet the severall
suits are uniforme to themselves. In the first court, therefore,
stood the Kiosk, the square tent, round tent, and the
<i>Capagasi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> etc., and Long tent; in the 2d Court the <i>odà</i>,
and many tents at distance two <i>oghlans</i>, or pages; and
others in the third court were all other offices, Kitching,
sherbets, etc. One side of this outward wall in the Maidan
reached 400 paces; but that may alter, according to the
ground on which they pitch it, which may be lesse, or far
more, and the figure may alter; the foreside was about 100
paces. They have many bales of wall tents to adde upon
occasion. We went in at a side door, having obtein’d first
leave of the Capagasi; before the great or common door
stood six Javelings, which, with horse-tayles about their
upper end, and a golding globe at top, about 4 yards
high, and just before them was pitch’t a round ordinary
tent, where the hangman set, and all publick justice is
done in the sight of the G. Sr., who stands in his little
Kiosk.</p>

<p>Upon the right hand, going up from thence, stood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Mosäifs<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> tent with 3 horse tayles before it, as every vizier
of the bench hathe; but they have but two great tents in
their first court, to wit, the square and long one. Next to
his was the Muftis,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> then the two Cadeleskiers’,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> all with but
two tayles before them; then several bashes tents, then the
vizier’s tents, in all things equall to the G. Sr.’s in pomp and
fashion, onely his walls are plain (as the rest of the great
men), without battlements, and the balls of gold are lesse.
The bignesse likwise of his tents did not agree, though that
may depend upon the pitching, for the square tent or
portico was 12 paces long and 8 broad. These tents were
canvas without and within the ground, but the flowers were
bits of cloth, satten, painted and gilded leather, very little
silver and gold about them. In the place of audience was
a stool cover’d with purple velvet for Embassadores
audience; befor his 3 tayles was also a round tent for
Justice; there sit also his under officers, to write Ashrs.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
One side of his tent reach’t down about 330 paces, the
bredth at head was 80. Next, at a good distance, was the
Vizier’s tent; a long one stood without, where he or his
<i>Hasnadar</i><a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> gave audience to all that came. He has two
courts within; one long tent for himself, with artificial
gardens about it, and all his slaves and waiting servants in
7 or 8 more round about him; these in the first court. In
the second his agà,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and other tents for other servants. I
have been treated there several times by his <i>sherbetjé basha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
who was my friend; his tent is full of fingians,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> snowpit
fountain water, etc., all ready coffee, etc. Never tasted such
sherbert in my life. All these tents front to one center; in a
circle in the midst are tents belonging to the <i>Dafterdar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
where stood openly many, many sopets with money and
treasure. Behind Kaseamstapha basha the G. Sr.’s son-in-law,
Kaimachan of Adrianople. When we were there I
was informed that they alwayes pitch’t in this form. Behind
the vizier were all the other bashas, and many other officers
and servants. When they are at war the Janissaryes are
placed round on the outside.</p>

<p>Now, on the land by Chalcedon is built a lighthouse or
Pharos, which they call (as likewise a little village by it)
Pheneir, and Phenerè,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> as at Pompey’s pillar, which I
question not was erected for the same purpose. Coming
from thence, on the shoar towardes the factory seraglio is a
fair large fountain; just by it a garden new empaled, and
enlarged much bigger then it was. A great kiosk in it,
then ready furnish’t for the G. Sr.; under it, about 15 or 20
steps, is a fountain of delicate water, which the G. Sr. uses
now daily. At Scutary there are very fine walks, all
shaded with Cipresse (most), pine, firre, some oak, ash,
Lotus, horse chesnut, cherry, beach, and other trees; there
are new taken in two or three vinyards. There are several
Arbors cover’d with vines of delicate grapes. The Bustange<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
invited us in, and treated us very civilly.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>I was at the Dervises in Galata, which Dervise Mustapha
the Näizam bashè, or head of the players of the pipe which
they call Näi.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> He hath been there 14 years, his pay is 45
aspers<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>; to the rest he payes 5, 6, 7, 8, or more, as they are
deserving. They have 100 kilos of wheat per annum, 100
per annum vacoof,<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> 3,000 aspers per man; from the G. Sr.,
10 sheep at little Beiram, 100 at Ramazam. They have
usuall prayers in the houses, and he that is devout may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
pray all night long, fast, etc. There are 4 Tekyes<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> or
monasteryes, of them here one, two Kasoumpasha, 3 Bisicktash,
4 Yenicapon; on Stambal side there are eighteen sorts
of them. These founded first by Molàh Hunkyòr, Harset
meulanàh, for he goeth by both these names. Heretofore
they preach’t, danc’t, and piped every Tuesday and Friday.
3 lye here buryed: 1. Arzéh Mahmet effendi, a great benefactor
to them; 2. Ismèl Effendi, who was once their
sheik (or head, though it signifies prince) and benefactor;
3. Ismaèl Effendi, another benefactor, who built them 10
chambers, and left them 1,000 dollars. They let their
neighbours be there buried for their money. Formerly, the
<i>Baltagee</i><a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> of Galata seraglio were buryed there; now they
have a corner apart. There Govisè Achmet is their Sheich
now, who receives all the money, and hath himself 1½<i>d.</i> per
day. Their musick is a Tambor, and a long week small
lute with wire strings, to which they sound their Nai or
pipe, whereof they have two sorts, a base and a treble; for
the middle ones partake of that to which they are nearest.
The little pipes have 7 holes on the upper side all in a row,
and an eighth at the bottom, a little of one side, and just in
the middle (measuring from that lowest eighth hole upwards)
on the back is a 9th hole. Some of these are a foot and ½
long; some lesse, some more. The long pipe hath six
holes, on one side three, and three at equal distances, and
on the back side, just half way, there is a 7th hole. There
is neither a fipple<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> above, nor noze<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> in the mouth, but the
head is a horn sloped up and brought to a very fine edge,
which leaning sidewayes to the mouth, gives the sound, as
boyes (with us) used to whistle in acorn cups, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
πλαγιαῦλος<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>; whence our flagiolet. Shepherds use smal pipes of
wood with such mouths, and some I have seen of the wings
and thigh bones of Crowes, Bustards, Pelicanes, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> from
whence of old were cal’d <i>tibia</i>. These dervish pipes are very
dear, not one of twenty proving good and true. The
smallest and deepest he ask 3 dollrs. for, and some of the
largest he vallued at 20 dollrs. One (which had belong’d
to the Convent these 300 yeares) he valued at 50 dollrs.; yet
more for its sweetnesse, then antiquity. They play mournfull tones,
but seldom any poynt of musick. They are all
made of Indian canes, just such as we make our fishing-rods
in England of; the workmanship and luck in proving
good give them their price. At every joynt they are whipt
with gut strings, more for ornament then strength. The
present G. Sr. is much delighted with them.</p>

<p>We went to see the vaults under Sta. Sophia; they
were full of water, then 17 ft. deep, and overhead from the
water up to the top of the arch, about 2 yards and 6 inches.
Every pillar is square 4½ feet, and distant one from another
just 12 feet. The bricks very broad, thin, wel baked; not
playstered within; the mortar very hard. They say it goes
under Atmaidan<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>; we could not enter it. The wast water of
the aquaeduct enters into it and out of it, passing through
the Seraglio goes into sea by the dunghill. Severe punishment
to have houses with offices into it, or throw any filth
into it; the well of Sta. Sophia runs into it, and many
wells in the Seraglio, etc.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">An Account of our Journey to Adrianople, 1675.</span></h4>

<p>You must note that in Turkey navigators reckon their
way by houres, not by miles; however, I have made an
estimate of every dayes journey both wayes, reckoning
3 miles to the hour, and, truely, I believe that our pace in
generall did come pretty just to that proportion.</p>

<p><i>May 2d, 1675.</i> To <i>Ponte piccolo</i>, hours 7½, miles 23.
Upon a Sunday, after morning prayer and a sermon, we
set out, being about 100 horsemen. My Ld. and Sr. Tho.
Baines<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> road in a kind of double horse litter, used by the
great men in Turkey, caryed by 4 mules, cover’d with fine
wrought cloath. The name for this thing is a <i>Takt-i-rovan</i>,
which is as much as a running seat (<i>Takt</i>, “seat”; <i>reván</i>,
“current”) in Persian, from whence they have taken this
state. There were four muliteers to attend upon it, and
two <i>Mestagées</i>,<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> or fire caryers, to go before it; they carry
upon a great staff, or short pole, an Iron made just like our
beacons, into which, when evening is come, they put <i>Pinus
sylvestris</i>, which they call <i>Sheráh</i>, or χερὰ, and being very
fat and unctious, it flames and burnes well, and lasts long;
but to supply their fire they have each man his bag full of
shivers and splinters of the wood, with which they tend this
fire. Wherever my Ld. (as the like is observed to the
vizier, and all other great persons travayling) took up his
lodging, so soon as it began to grow darke, they came and
fixed these beacons, by irons sharpened on purpose at the
lower end, just before his door (or tent, when he lay in
one), and then began a short prayer for the Gr. Signor, the
Embassador (or their patrone), and all the company, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
naming every one, the Treasurer, Secretary, Papas
(or chaplain), Turgemen, etc. This is the use of the
Countrey, and if the grandees travayl in the night, or goe
but a street’s length in their cityes, these <i>Mestages</i> goe
before them instead of lanthorn men, or torches. I thought
good to mention them thus fully here, because here it first
occurres, and you will meet with them often in the insuing
story. My Ld. had a coach also, which went by empty
with six horses, postillions, trappings, etc., all <i>alla Turchesca</i>
(as the fashion here); the coachman rides on one of
the hinder horses, and not in the boxe, though sometime I
have observed it. So likewise the chief <i>Turgeman</i> (or as
we commonly call him, the <i>Dragoman</i>) had his coach and
4, large; all the principle attendants there had also their
carts (or rather waggon coaches) with 4 wheels, and some
two horses; some three horses all abreast. I fancy your
<i>Trigae</i><a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> were such; for I have observed here many antient
customs and fashions yet remaining. I, amongst the rest,
was appointed to have one to carry my cloathes and other
baggage, as likewise I had my servant, and a <i>seis</i>, or groom,
to look after my horse. There were above 60 of these
waggon coaches in all, with all this trayn, and about 20 or
30 strangers that went onely to set us out the Town. We
left Pera, May 2d, and though our way from Stambul is
direct and short, yet, we being on the other side of the
water (the Sinus Ceratinus), we were forc’t to go about by
the meadowes, where, by the help of two bridges, we past
the two streames (or cornua) that meet to make up the
creek that separates Pera from Stambal. Within 1½ h. we
came to the first rivulet, cal’d of old <i>Barbyses</i>. About a
mile further we passed the 2d rivulet, of old <i>Cydarus</i>; both
are very accurately described, with all the little hills
and valleys about them, by <i>P. Gyllius</i>, in his Bosp. Thrace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
l. 2, c. 3, onely <i>Barbyses</i> hath a stronger current, especially
in winter. I have been often times <i>alla caccia</i>
from one end to the other of it. A mile further we
came to the suburbs of Stambal, commonly called Job’s
tomb, but it is the dormitorys or Mausoleums of severall
Turkish princes, Viziers, warriors, and men of fame
amongst them, one whereof was called Jüpe (as they now
call Jacob, and the Armenians call him Agúp), which gave
name to the place, and I veryly believe <i>Gyllius</i>, l. 2, c. 2,
was either mistaken or misinformed when he calls him
<i>Aibabarius</i>, for the Turkes call the place <i>Aiübazár</i>, which
is the mercate place of Jüp (<i>Bazár</i> being in Turkish the
Mercate place, as Balukbazár, etc., the fish mercate, etc.). I
have been often there amongst the tombs. From Jüp
bazár we came under Stambal walls, which are distant
from thence about ½ mile, and, passing about a mile further,
we came to Adrianople gate, from which we insisted on the
direct great road, as followeth about three mile of; we
crosse a little rill, not much worth your notice, but onely I
resolved to set down every water run, that (if possible) I
might give some light to your antient Geographers, our
common maps (Ortelius, Ptolomy, Sansoin, etc.) being very
false. We left two little Turkish townes on our right hand,
<i>Dav’d Basha</i> (David Basha), a mile from Adrianople gate,
and as much farther <i>Hasnadarcui</i> (Treasurer’s town); <i>cui</i>
is a common termination, as <i>ton</i>, <i>don</i>, etc., with us, and
signifyes a village or town. A little beyond the foresaid
rill is a very large <i>chinàr</i>, or plane-tree, with a square green
bank cast up about it, and a very noble fountain by.
Here in sommer many come to take their <i>spasso</i> and
recreation in the shade (which that tree casts), sitting upon
carpet with tobacco, coffee, and pure water, etc. Three
miles farther we cross two other little rills, which meeting
together (and, as I suppose, with the former), make a large
stream, which enters the sea between Stambol and Cape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Stephano (the mouth being within 2 mile of this latter).
About a mile farther is a brook (then it was dry) with a
stone bridge of 6 arches, and a little farther a rivulet with
a stone arch over it. I verily believe all these unite and
enter the sea as above say’d, for all the way from the first
to the last is low, flat ground, and these may very well
meet there towards the sea; but I am convinct of it by
reason I have been at <i>Ponte piccolo</i> by water many a time,
and never observed any other outlet into the sea but in
the place aforesaid. We come from Adrianople gate to
<i>Ponte piccolo</i> in 4 hrs.; it must be about 12 miles.</p>

<p><i>Ponte piccolo</i> is called by the Turkes K’ootchóok chekmejé
(it is little chest or cabinet), by the Greeks μικρὸ χωριὸ,
or little town. It is inhabited partly by Greekes, partly by
Turkes, and is about the bignesse of Newmarket. It has
one large street, through which lyes the road, in which are
many shops of victuallers, Knackers, and makers of horse
furniture, smiths, etc., all fitted for travaylers. There are
severall (<i>Chans, or caravanserais</i>) stables, and lodgings for
passengers: that is, roome and provisions for horses and
mules, and by them room for men to lye down; but if you
carry not your couches or quilts with you, you must take
up your lodging upon the cold ground here, and everywhere
else in Turkey upon the road; as likewise your
victualls in some places may be had drest for you in such
shops as I have mention’d, or else you must carry it with
you, and cook it yourself, or live upon barly and chopt
straw with your horse. Here our caterer (or purveyor)
found very good fish of all sorts by reason of the sea and
a lake being very nigh, but in other townes travaylers find
nothing but leekes, garlick, onyons, bread, salt, pickled
olives, cabbidge, cowcombers, melons, and the like, little
bits of broyl’d flesse, which they call <i>Kibób</i>, but whole
joynts nowhere, rice, pancakes, and severall kinds of
pastery meates. We, being so many in number, had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
man who alwayes went before to every <i>Conáck</i>, or stage, and
brought in muttons, beafes, veales, and the like, what he
could get, having two <i>Chiaúses</i> to assist him, else the
people would in most places not afford us anything, the
best Turkes, if they travayl alone, being content with the
fare of the road above-named. At our entrance on the
East side the town standes the Turke’s <i>Mosché</i>, and a
college, or hospital, both built by one <i>Abdisalláh</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the
Slave of God), <i>Tefterdóre</i> (Treasurer) to <i>Sultan Solyman</i>;
(others say to Sultan Osman). There is there allowed
maintenance for three learned men in the law, or Chiefes,
at one dollar per diem, as likewise rice, butter, bread, etc.,
for them and twenty more students there under them, who
have the salary of 18 Aspers per diem. There my Ld. and
all us that belong’d to his court were lodged, and they,
according to their statutes, at night came and brought us
two or three great platters of their pottage (made of rice
and onyons, etc.), and for everyone a loaf of their bread.
Any great personage passing that way may lodge there,
and cannot be denyed neither room nor this entertainment.
They get well by it, for at parting every great man leaves
some charity to them, as we also did. There is a pretty
large court, as bigge as the second in Emanuell Coll., one
story high, with cloysters and little chambers (with chimneys)
round about, and a fountain in the middest. All
passengers carry their own beds, or mats, or quilts to sleep
on and set on, for, as is before said, you find room, but
nothing but the bare wall besides. I and two or three
companyons slept on carpets in the Cloysters, it being very
hot weather; my Ld. and Sr. Tho. Baines had travayling
beds to set up and take down upon all occasions. Our
cookes and such like went allwayes before us, and in every
Conack we had our provisions ready all the way against
our coming in. At the end of the great street we past
over a water and a moory ground by a long bridge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
causeway, having a great lake on the right hand and the
Sea on the left, separated by a small peninsula of land.
The bridge hath 12 arches: the first, <i>Ponte piccolo</i>, very
large, next the Town over the chief stream; then two lesse
at a good distance; then nine more as much farther. These
last serve only to let the water passe that fall from the
hills in winter, and would be prest up by the bridge and
caseway, and so otherwise would endanger both. The bridge
is stone, rayed (striped) with slight timbers on each side. It
is about 312 of my paces long, broad enough for 3 carts to
passe one by the other; to it is joyned the caseway of
stone 462 of my paces, and at the bridge foot it is about
2½ foot high. I find this lake in Ortelius map of old
Thrace to be cal’d <i>Myrmex Lacus</i>, but he hath not taken
notice of a fresh water river that runs through it, which I
have rowed up and down at least 5 or 6 miles. It runs
with a small but very strong stream, so that at the mouth,
where it empties itself into the sea, our boates from <i>Stambol</i>
enter with great difficulty, as likewise it is very deep and very
strong under the great Arch of the bridge, where, though
the water continually sets out, yet the water in the lake
tastes brackish. Up this fresh river, about 5 or 6 mile, is
on the right hand a very high and steep mountain, with a
most famous cave, which runs 10 or 12 mile underground,
and is hewn in many places that two or three men may
walk abreast at their full height.</p>

<p><i>May 3d.</i> To <i>Ponte grande</i> 4¼ h., miles 13. Going from
<i>Ponte piccolo</i>, so soon as you are of the caseway and past
the moor you rise up an easy hill, at the foot of which,
just by the corner of the lake, is a little village on your
left hand call’d <i>Coomcui</i>, or Sand-town, from the sand hard
by there in the lake; onely Greekes live in it, and have
forgot the Greek name, or else it never had any. About a
mile or two farther on the right hand, at the edge of the
lake, is another, called by the Greekes <i>Cabárana</i>. Half way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to <i>Ponte grande</i> you leave a little Greek town on the right
hand hardly cal’d <i>Ahúrcui</i>; thence you descend a little
but very steep valley, and in the bottome is a little river
with a stone bridge of three arches. This valley is not
much above one mile over, but is a very dangerous place
for robberys and murders, and therefore is cal’d by the
Turkes <i>Aram-derry</i>, or accursed valley. On the brow of
the hill on the other side this valley stands a very fine but
little queach<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> of popalar, cipresse, and some elme and
willow trees very thick to-gether; it is paled in very high,
like one of our parkes. In the midst of it is a seraglio of
the G. Signor’s, where formerly they came in summer for
pleasure. Under the pales, upon the road, is a couple of
clear and very large fountaines with severall cisternes,
where some few comrades of us made a halt and took a
dram of the bottle. <i>Ponte grande</i> is cal’d by the Turkes
<i>Buyoók-checmedje</i> (or great-chest, abusing the word <i>checkmése</i>
for a wooden bridge, as both these and the other bridges
at <i>Ponte piccolo</i> at first were of wood), in Greek μεγάλο
χωριὸ, or great town. The inhabitants are most Turkes,
some Jewes and Armenians, but more Greekes mixt with
them. The road and the sea makes this Town, as well as
<i>Ponte piccolo</i>, flourish. This is bigger then it; there is
likewise good store of excellent fresh-water fish, as likewise
of sea fish. On the west side the town lyes a great Lake
which hath communication with the sea, and seemes to
have been an arme of it antiently, but now cut of from it
except in 4 places which we passe by bridges, now of late
yeares made of stone, but there remain ruines of wood,
which show them to have been of old of timber upon stone
cheekes,<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> to draw up and down and move into the Lake,
we passing them to the right hand. The water, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
past, was not very deep. These four bridges are joyned
together by stone casewayes, which in winter, if more rain
falls then is vented by the arches or covered with it, yet
there being room for the water to play, all is with out
danger or damage, the stones towards the lake being
clenched with lead one to another. The first case-way from
the street end is 60 paces, that bridge is 183 paces with
7 arches; 2d caseway, 39 paces; the bridge 166, with
7 arches; 3d caseway, 19 paces; the bridge 127 with 5
arches; 4th caseway, 14 paces; the bridge 233 with
9 arches; the last caseway about 30 paces—all soe wide
as three carts may goe abreast. I am the more particular
in these little things, that you may see the Turkes are
neither niggards nor fooles in these public workes, for I
assure you I never saw stronger work than among them;
and some things are as fine and neat as we can possibly
shew. There is a large river which enters this lake at the
north, but runs not very swift. The Greekes call it now
Μαυροπόταμι, the Black river; the Turkes very near the
same, <i>Kará-sou</i>, Black water. Now judge you whether
<i>Athyrus</i> runs here or no.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The sea comes up to the
bridge; though it is very shallow, yet it is a pretty harbour
for small vessells out a little farther between the two capes,
and this little port addes to the greatnesse of this town
above the other <i>ponte</i>, where there is none. My Ld. was
Lodged on the side of the Lake, at the end of the Town;
the weeds and dead carcases, and other filth which they
dayly cast in, in the hot weather, made so foul a stink as
we were all almost stifled with it. Here are in the town
many, many <i>chanes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> besides where we lay, and several
pretty large streets. For building, once for all I must tell
you there is none all over Turkey but what is very mean
and beggarly, and for the most part dark and sluttish: I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
except your Moschés, Seraglios, and publick buildings
onely. Some great men of late (as this present Vizier
now at Stamboul) have ventured upon great buildings for
themselves, but it doth often prove their ruin; they
becoming thereby suspected for becoming too great, and
so the G. Signor cuts them of and seizes their possessions.</p>

<p><i>May 3d.</i> To <i>Selibria</i> h. 5¾, miles 17. Going from <i>Ponte
grande</i>, so soon as we had past the bridges and began
to rise up the hill, there we past two little townes, both
inhabited by Greekes; one on the right hand called
Πλάγια, the other on the left, by the sea, called Καλικράρια.
We called at these by reason of the fame of good wine
there, which we found true. About 6 or 7 miles from
thence, on the left hand, stands a little town on a promontory
looking into the sea; the name I could not learn.
About a mile farther we passe a little rill, and a mile beyond
that (which is about half way to Selibria), we go by a
little ruinated town, just in the very sea, the road lying
upon the sand; the town stands to the right hand, in
Turkish <i>Koombúrgás</i>, or sand-burough<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>; in Greek Κουμιὸ, a
word corrupted from the Turkish <i>Koóm</i>, which is sand.
We had very good wine there, especially a small sort of
claret. There hath been formerly a little castle or fort
there, but all the great stones are picked out and carryed to
<i>Stambol</i>. The <i>Valedéh-Jámisi</i> and <i>Valedéh-Chane</i>,<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> <i>i.e.</i>, the
Q. Mother’s Mosch, and the Publick <i>Chane</i> or <i>Hostelry</i>, was
built with part of them. As once for all, I must tell you
that round Stambol for many miles the Turkes have taken
almost all the fair stone they could find to rayse their
buildings in the City, so that little is to be expected of
inscriptions or monuments of antiquity; especially in
Thrace, or anywhere near the shore of the Propontis, from
whence caryage by sea is easy. Nothing remaining in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
manner but the inward part of the walls of old buildings;
the Maidan,<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> the case or outside of it was of good stone,
being pull’d down and disposed of. This hath been a pretty
town, but now it is nothing by its situation. About 2 miles
from hence we passe another, a pretty mercate towne, and
rich by reason of the road, and a little port for small boates.
It is cal’d in Turkish <i>Bogáthos</i><a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>; the inhabitants are most
Greekes, but in the great street are many Turkes. There
is yet standing a little tower with very thick walls, which is
now turned into a granary. About three miles from thence
we enter into a Moorish ground, which we passe by. A
caseway and bridges of stone, of one arch apiece, over as
many little streames, deep, but very narrow, which uniting
hard by, enter the sea (which is all the way in sight to our
left hand), in one pretty large channell; it being the onely
stream that deserves the name of a river from <i>Ponte-grande</i>
to <i>Heraclea</i> (Erekli).</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p><i>May 5th.</i> To Ciorlúh (Chiorlóo we pronounce it), 8½ h.,
25 mi.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Going from Selibria,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> we leave the Sea (having hitherto
had it all the way on our left hand), and mount, arising
well into a plain champion<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> country, as indeed all the way
to Adrianople is champion. Scarce a tree, unless some few
about <i>Chiorlóo</i> to be seen; by which you may imagine
what brave hunting and hawking the G. Signors have
there. Just under Selibria runs a small rill, which enlarges
into a kind of pond at the very town, over which we past
by a stone bridge of 4 arches; and about a quarter of a
mile further we enter a moorish ground, in which is a very
fair stone bridge of 32 arches, and with the ascents at each end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
it is about 450 paces. The water under it was little and did
not run, which made me conclude the bridge built onely in
case of land floods in winter time, which must needs be
occasioned by rain from the neighbouring hills, they being
steep and enclosing this flat ground on every side. I
could perceive this overflowing water enter’d the Sea in
one mouth with the little rill before mentioned; and besides
this there is no other river near to <i>Selibria</i>. About 8
mile of from it by the sea side I crosst another little one
as I came home. Out of this moor we rise (as is said) to
the top of a hill, into a plain, which is a black spongy soil,
and seemes to be very binding, for there we saw them at
plow with 6, some 7, some 8 yoke of oxen in a plow;
especially where they were new breaking up. The first
town we came at was called <i>Kinnekléh</i>,<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> a little Turkish
town in a very fertile playn. About half way we crost a
little river, which enters the sea about 3 or 4 miles to the
W. of Heraclea, or rather is that just now mentioned 8 mile
from Selibria.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p><i>Chiorlóo or Chiorlúh</i> hath been a very large town, as
it is yet most inhabited by Turkes, yet there are Armenians,
Jewes, and Greekes too. It is not onely a great
road town, but also a very great trade, and mercate is
driven there for all sorts of commodityes. On the east
side the town runs a great dry grasse, as big as the Divels
ditch at Newmarket, in which are severall fountaines,
yet standing, of excellent water. At the lower end (from
the Town) it is crost with an aquaeduct of 96 paces
long (the distance from edge to edge of the grass), with
one onely little high arch in the midst. It is decay’d
and dayly running to ruine, yet the earthern pipes on the
top are yet whole, and the water runs still in them.
It was a very antient way of conveighing water, and far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
beyond either wood or lead. I saw several old ones at
<i>Carthage</i>, <i>Ephesus</i>, <i>Smyrna</i>, etc., which must needs some of
them have lain in the ground thousands of yeares unperisht.
I shall briefly give you this description: they
make earthen trunks about foot and half (sometimes little
more) long; one end is made with a shoulder, the other end
with a female grove (to receive that end of a second trunk).
Now to close each joynt they have an excellent mortar,
which they call <i>Lukiúm</i> or <i>Lookioóm</i>; it is made of unslaked
lime and beaten brick, most finely powdered and sifted,
cotton wool very thinly pul’d and strew’d on, and then all
slaked with linseed oyle and mixt together, then they reject
whilst it is fresh made, otherwise it hardens immediately.
Then care is to be taken that the trunkes be kept from
force, and they will endure to eternity. Beneath this dry
grasse to the North are many vinyards, fig trees, etc. There
have been within this 20 yeares here in town above 400
Greek familyes, now they are shrank to near upon 100; yet
they are forc’t to pay the same <i>Harátch</i> (pol money) and
other dutyes (for <i>the G. Signor’s lead cannot sink</i>; he will lose
nothing of what once is settled to him), which comes to
1,000 dollrs. per annum, just as they did before; which
makes the poor creatures yearly break and run away.
They have but one Church, a little poor thing, but kept
spruce and neat, there belonging to it a Bp., 4 priests, and
2 deacons. I was there at Vespers with them, and found
them extremely civil, and they shewed me all the town.
Over their church door they have fixt a pittyfull marble
stone, which they saved out of the ruines of an old castle
that was here; it was all flead<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> to build the Turkish moschs,
which are at least 12 in all.</p>

<p><i>May 6th.</i> To <i>Karesterán</i><a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> 6 h., miles 17. Going from
<i>Chiorloo</i>, about a little mile, we passe a little river; over
it was an old stone bridge, almost broken down, which
have had 4 arches. Just half way to <i>Karesterán</i> we passe
a good large river, though in sommer it is almost damn’d
up with sand; there is a good large bridge over it of wood,
but slight timbers in it. All the way it was still Champion
ground, most like a black moorish soyl, yet I judged it
lighter than that on the other side <i>Ciorlóo</i>, because we saw
severall ploughs with but 4 oxen in them, and those yoaked
all abreast. The town has its name from <i>Karismack</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
to mingle or knead; for the least rayn (as we experienced
when we were there) makes the spongy, soapy
(fuller’s) earth just like past. Upon the S.E. side of the
Town, about one quarter of a mile, runs a small river, but
very strong stream; there is a bridge there with 8 arches
and about 100 paces in length. The river may easily in
many places be leapt over; yet in winter the water overflows
farre. From a delicate cleer fountain on the same side the
town beyond this river, upon the side of the hill (to our
right hand, as we descend to come hither), is an Aquæduct
brought, and in the valley are three steps or pyramids
built to divide the water into severall trunks, as also to let
the overplus run in winter, without prejudice to the course
of the rest. Just about the spring growes infinite of excellent
<i>scordium</i>,<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> which I have found an excellent preservative
against the plague. Here is a very good Mosch here, and
a large <i>cháne</i>. The town is enriched onely by travailers;
at present it is but small, and built but in latter times out
of the mines of Miso.</p>

<p><i>May 7th.</i> To <i>Bourgas</i><a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> 4 h., miles 12. About 2 or 3
miles from <i>Carestéran</i> are several decay’d fountaines by
the road side. At 4 mile is a very good fountain that runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
plentifully, with cisternes for horses to drink. A little
farther are several little rills, with one arch’t bridges over
them, and hard by a pretty big river, but no bridge. Just
half way on the left hand, on the very road, is raysed
a good great hill, with a <i>fossa</i><a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> about it, and an entrance on
the side next the road up to it. I take it to be a monument
of the dead, slain in some battle fought upon these
plaines. We have observed many such, as shall be say’d:
it was an antient custome and right paid to kings (as about
Gallopoly) and inferior persons. It is as high as Bartlow
hills, but the fossa is in a manner fill’d up. From the top
we counted 12 villages spread round about; it is seen
almost to <i>Burgas</i>. Within two mile of <i>Burgas</i> the earth
alters to a lighter kind of sandy soyl, yet Plowmen were
there breaking up with 6 yoak of oxen in a plough.</p>

<p>Burgas is a pretty large market town. We passe over a
pretty street or two; then came a most stately <i>Cháne</i>, having
a fair square court and large fountain in the middest of it,
and cloysters round about; then fine apartments able to
hold well nigh 1,000 travaylers with their beasts. This is
joyned to a very brave <i>Mosch</i> by a large <i>Cupola</i> crosse the
main road, supported by 4 arches (28½ feet wide); the
street passe under two, and the passage from the <i>Cháne</i> to
the Mosch goes under the other. Entering into the Kháne
(for you must pronounce it in the throat) sit many shopkeepers;
amongst the rest, the finest Tobacco-pipe heads are
sold there that are to be found in Turkey. The Town is
all Turkish, and very populous for the bignesse. Mahomet,
Vizierarém<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> to Sultan Solyman, had a son, Bassa of Morea;
complaints were made of him at court. The G. Signor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
bid him advise his son to do better. He, without any
more adoe, sent and took of his head and presented
it to the G. S., who for his severe government in that
point gave him all his son’s estate (which otherwise falls
to the G. S.), with which he built several noble buildings,
whereof this <i>Kháne</i> and Mosch are none of the least. On
the W. side the Town (which we past the next day) runs
a small river, on which stands a Turkish mill, driving 3
pair of quernes (each mill grinding 10 <i>Kilos</i> or bushels of
wheat in 12 houres), and yet the water there is not so wide
but I could easily step over it. They are Greekes that forme
the mill, which belong to Ἁγιαβὰλὰκ, a little town (concerning
which more presently) hard by. There is also just by
this town a tile kill, formed by other Greekes of the same
place; though the soyl all the way hither is black and
spongy moorish ground, yet here is so good a naturall
mixture of sand as to make most excellent tile. Over the
river, going out of town, is a bridge of 4 arches, long in
all 146 paces; the stream is nothing in sommer, but the
Town standing in a kind of pan in winter, it must needs
be great. The stone with which this bridge is built is
such a porous kind of hard <i>pumex</i> as I never beheld; it
seem’d to me to have been made of clay and pills of
sand, which afterwards mouldring away might cause those
eyes. Down the river hard by is a Turkish town cal’d
<i>Múctary</i>.</p>

<p><i>May 8th.</i> To <i>Bobbás-cui</i> 4½ h., miles 13. About a mile
from Burgas, standing upon a little hill on the left hand,
we saw ἁγιαβαλὰκ, a little Greek town (as is said), but very
populous, there being now above 400 familyes in it, many
of the men going out to work all the week (as before is
intimated), and returning on Saturday, live very well, they
being farre more industrious then any of the Greekes I
ordinarily ever met with. About six mile of from <i>Bobbas-cui</i>
we crossed a little brook; a mile and ½ farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
another; as far again a third, with bridge, all almost dry.
An old Turk took it from the Christians, and from him it
is now so named, for <i>bobbá</i><a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> is the common name for
<i>Father</i>, and is given to every old man in common discourse.
He lyes buryed in St. Nicholas’ church, the one thing remaining
of the Greekes memoriall or building here. It is
made a place of prayer, and he is reckoned a great saint
amongst the common people. When we went into it to
see his tomb we met another old Turk, who had brought
three candles, and presented them to an old woman that
looks after it, and shews it to strangers. He said he had
made a vow in distresse to do it. The old woman told us:
Yes, my sons, when ever you are in danger pray to this
good holy man, and he will infallibly help you. Oh, fye!
sister, quoth the old Turk, do not so vainly commit sin, for
he was a mortall man and a sinner as well as we. I know
it, quoth the old wife, that onely God doth all, and he doth
nothing; but God for his sake will the sooner hear us; and
so ended that point of Turkish divinity. This Church is
standing pretty intire. It is but little (as I above said, I
guesse most others were), but very handsome, in the same
forme almost with Sta. Sophia, with a great <i>Cupola</i> over the
body of it; but the outward wall is scaloped. On the east
side the town as we goe in runs a little pretty river just
under this church, and hath a very well built stone bridge
as ever I saw for the bignesse, of a very hard freestone.
It is broad enough for 3 carts to goe abreast. It is 232 of
my paces, beside the ascents at each end. It hath 6 little
arches in the midst, and severall little flood-gates on each
flank. All stones are rob’d here, likewise to build their
Moschs, which here are 3 or 4, one very fine one. The
town is a pretty large town, and will dayly increase.
<i>Ibrahim bassa</i> (now General of the Turks’ army), in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
bringing an Aquæduct thither, the shafts were open’d not
far of from the W. side the town.</p>

<p><i>May 9th.</i> To <i>Háfsa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> 6 houres, miles 18. Going a little
out of Bobbas-cui, on the left hand, is another great hill,
cast up, I suppose, on the same account with that between
<i>Coresteran</i> and <i>Burgas</i>, but not so big, nor so high. Upon
the Top of it lyes now a very long Turkish tomb. That I
may here tell you the difference, you must know that they
never lay anything over their dead but the earth. All the
sides of their tombs are good stone, but above nothing but
earth, except in your Royall Mausoleum or those of great
men. There they place a cænotaph over the grave, and a
great candle at head and feet, and at the head the fashions
of the cap he wore, by which is known whether he was a
man of the law, or some civil magistrate, or souldjer or
woman, etc.</p>

<p>About seven mile on the road we passe a little, little
hamlet cal’d <i>Coophátcui</i>, or <i>coophas-cui</i>. About a mile and
½ from thence (I guesse it half way) we crost a little brook
which ran plentifully, but as we return’d it was dry.
When we came within 3 or 4 mile of <i>Háfsa</i> we saw the top
of mount Rhodope, which lyeth beyond Adrianople to the
west, as afterwards shall be sayd. This name is wrote
severall wayes, but pronounced all alike. Here is a most
noble <i>Cháne</i>, farre better then that at <i>Burgas</i>, and likewise
a <i>Cupola</i> crosse the street, and a fair mosch annext in the
same manner there described; but these two latter are as
farre inferior as the other is superior. All were built by
the same Mahomet Vizierarem, who built those at Burgas;
thence they were made in the same fashion. He lyes
buried at <i>Jupe</i> (before mention’d) in a fair mausoleum
which I have seen; and it is reported of him that he
repair’d all the publick bridges in the Turkes’ territoryes
from Adrianople into the bounds of Persia; and built as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
many Moschs and Chánes as there are dayes in the year;
and by this means continued Vizier 40 years, an unusual
thing in this court, for it is a wonder in this present
<i>Kiuprili</i><a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> not so much that he succeeded his father, as that
he hath staid in so long.</p>

<p><i>May 10th.</i> To <i>Adrianople</i>, houres 5½, miles 17. Khavsa
lyes S.E. from Adrianople. Getting out of town (which
stand low) we again saw upon the first hill Rhodope
before us; at 8 miles end we passe a little brook; at 3 miles
farther another. With in 2 miles, or little more, of Adrianople
is a very good fountain, and fine <i>Kiosk</i> or summer-house
by it. Hither comes severall great men in summer to
take their pleasure. The city begins to appear about 4 or
5 mile of, and indeed it shews gloriously, as all their citys
doe at a distance, but within they are very mean and
beastly. The Moschs and <i>Minarys</i> (or steeples), which are
very stately, especially Sultan Selim’s mosch,<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> which is the
best here, of which more afterwards. The country (as is
said) all the way perfect champion ground with pleasant
easy hills and fruitful valleys; the soyle generally pretty
good, but it is much neglected; and though I have all
along mention’d several little villages, yet I assure you
this part of Thrace (taken in the whole) is very little
inhabited and lesse cultivated. About the townes and
villages we saw good husbandry; but elsewhere, I am
confident, above 2 thirds of the land lyes unoccupyed, and
where they neither plough nor plant vineyards, they
feed neither meat nor sheep, nor goat, nor anything else.
In many, many miles riding we saw neither corn-field, nor
pasture, nor flocks, nor herds, but onely wild neglected
champion ground. I have a catalogue of many fine plants
observed by the road, but I omitt that, and come now to
tell you how we were receiv’d and brought into the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
About 6 mile of the city we were met with all the French
and Dutch who, belonging to Pera with us, were then at
Adrianople to see sights. At <i>Soláck chesmi</i> (<i>or the Page’s
fountain</i>), which I just now mention’d, were provided 12 of
the G. Signor’s horses for my Lord and his attendance to
mount and ride into city with all; they were all admirable
good ones, and set out as rich as was possible. I left my
own and took one of them, whose bridle, saddle, great
stirrups, breast plate, buttock cloth, etc., were either all
of beaten gold and silver, or else most richly embroyder’d.
My Lord’s horses furniture were set out with jewels and
pearles most gloriously. There were groomes appointed
to attend upon every horse. By that time we were mounted
and got into the road and our ranks; we were met with the
<i>Capigé-pasha</i> (the word signifys chief porter), whose office
is much like our Master of the Ceremoneys, and the <i>Chiau’s
pasha</i> (or head <i>of the ciauses</i>, who are like our purcevants
or messengers of the green-cloth); these two were in their
court vests (Capsitans) of clothe and gold and silver, with
rich furres, and horses and furniture suitable. After them
followed 70 chiauses in their habits, and severall <i>cherbigées</i>
(colonels of the Janizaryes). We all made ... d till the
ceremony of use and complement past; then we went into
the city in this cavalcade; first the cherbigeés turned back,
then the Chiauses, then the <i>Capigé basha</i> and <i>Chiaus basha</i>,
then my Ld. (having the strangers that met us just before
him), then all the English gentlemen, then the servants,
then the <i>torch-bearer</i> with Sr. Tho. B., then the coach and
6 horse, then the other (Turgemans) coach; then all the
Carts followed. My Ld. had three good horses (of the
Companye), richly furnisht out, led by all the way from
Pera. The first street was lined with Janissaryes. We
were conducted with all this train to the house appointed
for my Ld.’s lodgings, and that street had Janisaryes likewise
on both sides. There the Turkes and strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
left us. The house we first were allotted was the
damn’dest, confounded place that ever mortall man was
put into; it was a Jewes house, not half big enough
to hold half my Ld.’s family, a mere nest of fleas and
cimici,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and rats and mice, and stench, surrounded with
whole kennells of nasty, beastly Jewes. We made shift
that night, and my Ld., sending to the Vizier, had another
immediately, which proved very convenient; for here
upon these occasions the G. Signor turnes out whome he
please (of Jewes or Christians) out of their house, so that
it is troublesome and dangerous to them for to have a
good house, and in that end of the town there is none,
being all Jewes, crowded two or three familyes into a
house that hath not more roomes. If the old Jewes were
such poisonous beasts, I must needs then allow their
frequent washings, and think they needed not touch a
dead body to be unclean, for they could not touch a
living one without being so; but more of them anon.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">An Account of Occurrences at Adrianople, 1675.</span></h4>

<p><i>May 17th.</i> The Ragusæan Ambassador visited my Ld.
His name was Márin Cabóga. The Turkes call this Embassador
(alwayes one being at Court here) Dóbra Benedíct,
which is as much as good Venetian. He was a lusty,
gallant fellow, and I got a very familiar acquaintance
with him, and found him merry, cunning in his businesse,
but most strangely superstitious as to storyes of witches
and such like. One day, being to visit him with a friend
of mine, he fell into such discourse, and at last assur’d us
that he had met with a Jew woman who, for certain, was a
witch. We desir’d to see her. She was cal’d; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
she came, she would not owne any such thing as that she
could raise the devil, but she would tell us many charms
and tricks: one was, this Signor Cabóga some few dayes
before had lost some money, and suspected one of his
servants for it. She comes with an Old Testament in
Heb[rew], and, tying a key in it at the 51st psalme, hang’d
it upon her finger on one side, and upon the finger of
another old hag (her camerade) on the other side. Then
he began to think of one whom he suspected, and immediately
he reads that psalm in any other language which he
understand (as he did it in Latine); if the person be guilty,
the Bible turnes and drops downe whilst he reads; if he be
innocent, it hangs immoveable to the end of the psalme;
then he thinks of another, and so begin again. This so
possest him as would needs have them shew it us, affirming
that when he thought of one person (whome he therefore
concluded guilty) it never fail’d. To work go the
old hags; he reads; down drops the book. We laught
and desir’d we two might hold it upon our fingers (for I
perceived the juggle most clearly: it falls with pressing
the finger a little stronger then ordinary); he consented,
and though he thought of the same person, the book
hang’d cleverly to the end in despite of Mother Mumpus.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
I bad him think of any other person in his mind, as
myself, or friend, or the old woman, etc., and before he had
gone half way I turned it with as much dexterity as if
Mephistophilus himself had been in my Elbo. My gentleman
was amazed, but these cunning Jades put a neat
conceit in his head. He told us this trick would not do
unlesse we were both of us clean; for, said he, it would not
do with me at first, for, to tell you the truth, I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
with a prettie girl, but, so soon as I had confest myself, it
never fail’d, so that all we could say (if we had 10,000
compurgators, it had been all one) would not persuade
him but one of us, or both, had been dabling. I told
him of our trick with the Sive, and shewed him the very
cheat, both in that and in this, and, with much adoe, we
convinct him a little. At last I understood indeed what
kind of Conjurers these two women were: they were
famous, truely, for raysing (or bringing up) little Devils,
but they were all in the shape of pretty wenches. One
I had the fortune to see, one as like <i>Cis Archer</i><a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> as if
some kind spirit had really conveigh’d her own very self
hither; and in troth it might be she, for these fairyes, I
veryly believe, had flesh and bones. He often recounted
to me the dreadful earthquake that happened at Ragusa
in Easter week, <i>1666</i><a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>; he, being himself in it, gave the
greater light and credit to his businesse. He had kil’d a
great man in a <i>rencontre</i>, and was imprisoned for it, and
sentence past upon him to suffer death; he being at his
prayers, expecting every moment to be cal’d forth to
execution, was, at a suddain, tost from one side of the
prison to the other, just under an arch, and that place
from whence he was joulted was blown up into the Ayre,
as if it had been done with gunpowder. After his fright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
was a little over, he got out, and in this sad juncture of
affaires behaved himself so gallantly, as he was not onely
pardon’d, but promoted, having been several times Ambassadore
here before. The greatest part of the houses in
the Town were shaken down, which was done at one blow,
without any antecedaneous trembling or admonition; but
after it follow’d a trembling, which ceased not perfectly in
4 yeares after. There were about 400 and odde noblemen
before this accident, but not above 140 escaped; yet not
one family of them was quite extinct. He onely was left
of his. There are not above 18 familyes antient amongst
them. From the harths that were in the houses over
thrown broke out all over the town a most dreadfull fire,
which continued 22 dayes; yet, notwithstanding it, and
the other terrible shock of the Earthquake, nothing of
their walls or fortifications, or any publick buildings, were
harmed in the least, neither was one corn of powder fired,
though all their magazines were then full. There was a
poor woman servant after 15 dayes digg’d out alive; she
had lived in a kitchen all that while, with a little dish-wash
and oatmeal left there by chance. He saw likewise
a little child digd out hanging at the mother’s brest
(who was dead) three whole dayes after this sad hap; the
child is yet alive. He is a very short man, and behaved
himself bravely against the Venetians, who afterwards
assailed the town. They pay to the G. Signor a yearly
tribute of 12,500 Hungars at 2½ dollars apiece, with <i>a dazio</i>
(as the merchants call it); it is often more, as now one is
valued at 2⅓ doll. Besides this tribute they are forced to
make presents at severall times of great solemnityes, as
now the G. Signor sent to them to come and honour the
Circumcision of his son and marriage of his daughter.
They were much confounded, not having any precedent
left of what ever had been pay’d before; but the <i>Chiá</i> (or
steward or deputy) to the Vizier favour’d them with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
record of what they paid about 80 yeares since in Sultan
Morat’s<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> time, which saved them much of what they intended
to have given. I was very much obliged to him,
for severall times he took me along with him to see sights,
and to be treated by the Turks (as you shall hear anon),
even to the envy of severall of our company.</p>

<p><i>May 19th.</i> My Ld. had audience with the Vizier for the
ceremony of it. It is the same with what is performed
here at any audience with the <i>Caimacham</i> or <i>Bostanje basha</i>.
We were conducted to his Pallace or Seraglio through the
City. Two Chiauses (which by order waited upon my Ld.
from Stambol continually till he return’d thither again)
and all our janizaryes leading of us, and we all following
on horseback, we were brought into a pretty large room
with a <i>soffá</i><a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> (a square raysed about 1½ foot from the ground)
covered with carpets very rich, and laid upon the 3 sides
next the wall with narrow quilts, or little beds, and great
bolsters round, all cover’d with cloth of gold. At audiences
at Stambol we putt of our shoes, but here it would be an
affront, as if we were afraid to spoil the Vizier’s goods; the
like is before the G. Signor. My Lord was placed upon a
low stool upon the sofá, and we all stood there close at his
back. Round about us stood many Chiauses and other
attendants. After about ½ of an houre’s stay in come the
Vizier, and drops himselfe down upon the couch crosse-leg’d.
My Ld.’s stool was put nearer to him. Just as he
came in all the waiters cry’d: Whish, whish, etc., in token of
silence (though I never saw such silence even to admiration
(as hereafter shall be said) without this sign), and at
his setting down they all give a great acclamation, as much
as <i>God blesse the G. Signor and him, etc.</i> Being thus sat
down, my Ld. deliver’d him the King’s letter, and told him
that his maister commanded him to do soe, and, with all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to speak something more to him by word of mouth.
Amongst other things, my Ld. urged very much the perpetuall
friendship of the English, and that in the warres of
Candia there appear’d not one English man against them
amongst those many other strangers that sided with the
Venetians; to which the Vizier answered it was true, he
himselfe was witnesse to it. My Ld. thanked him for so
speedy an audience. He smiled, and said it was a time of
mirth, and the great matters were laid aside awhile, so as
he had that leisure. My Lord wish’t it might ever be a
time of mirth and joy to him. Many such complements
past, though the Vizier was alwayes very brief and sparing
in his words, whether out of a formall gravity, or the reall
Turkish humour of taciturnity, I know not. He look’t very
pleasantly, and, as we were inform’d, with an unusuall
sweetnesse; though, at best, I assure you, I thought he had
Majesty and state enough in his face all the time, being all
the time of a very, very composed countenance, excepting
once (as is above said) we fancy’d some shadow of a smile.
He is but a little man, and goes (as I often afterwards saw
him) a little lamely, and something stooping thereupon,
which they say is from many issues which he hath about
him for the Sciatica.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> He hath a small round face, a little
short thin black beard, little eyes, little mouth, without any
wrinkles in his lips; a smooth round forehead and an
erected brow, with thick, but very short, hair on it. He is
pockbroaken much. In summe, he hath an acute but
morale and serious look; and, if I can judge anything, I
should think him a subtle cunning man, though I had
never heard so much from the world. He is, they say, 44
years old, though, for my own part, I guesse him not above
40, if so much. He was then in a Chiauses Cap, but he
hath severall, as I have seen him many times in them. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
all audiences, from the G. Sr. himself to the Kaimacham of
Stambol, we give presents, viz., vests of cloth, silk, cloth of
gold, silver, velvet, etc., and in most places we receive vests
from them, which are a peculiar sort of garment, onely to be
then put on by us, and the maisters of state wear them
upon peculiar occasions up and down the Court. They
are made like our sophisters’<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> gown, without a cape. The
stuff is of white silk, flower’d with great branches, sometimes
half moones (and the like), yellow or tawny, all with
very great weales<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>; and, according to the dignity of the
persons, they are of cloth, of silver, or gold, or with more
or less gold and silver wrought in the silk. There were
give 16 amongst us. I sold mine for 6½ dollrs. My Ld.’s
was worth 25 or 30; all the rest like mine, except the
Treasurer’s, Secretary’s, and chief Dragoman’s, which were
worth about 8 dollars a piece. I am confident this was a
very antient custome, and is mean’d in scripture by
changes of rayment, etc. We were with the vizier about
½ houre in all; my Ld. was with him in person not above
¼. After these little passes were over he rose up (the
waiters making the same acclamations), and bowing a little
to my Ld., past on, and we come out with my Ld. You
must understand at all audiences (except with the G. Sr.
himself, as you shall hear afterward) my Ld. is lead in and
out by the Treasurer and Secretary: one on the right, the
other on the left. The Cancellier to the Company, and one
or two of the merchants, viz., Mr. Cook and Mr. Salter, were
not vested, which you may imagine was taken amisse. My
Ld. would have talked of keeping peace with Tripoli, Algiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Tunis, etc., as likewise would have desired to treat by proxy
or in private, but it was not then thought convenient.</p>

<p><i>May 23rd.</i> The Resident (from the Emperor) of
Germany visited my Lord.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> There had been a little <i>pico</i>
taken. When Count Leshley<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> came into town Embassador
from the Emperor some time since, our Embassador was
then in town, and sent his secretary and court to meet him.
My Ld. expected that this resident should have done as
much to him. But he excused it, assuring my Ld. that he
was that day with all his court call’d about businesse
before the Vizier, and so all disgust was past over. His
name is Giovanni Christophoro, and sometimes he wrote it
Chinsberg; a most ingenious, courteous person; and as
wise and cunning a statesman. I was most infinitely
obliged for his civility, being often with him, and alwayes
treated like a prince. He is an excellent schollar; mathematicks
and history, and all manner of Antiquitys are his
chief delight. I shall have occasion to say more of him
anon; yet I will not omit one strange thing now. We had
been informed here by a very worthy gentleman that at
<i>Tocay</i> in Hungary the vine (which make the best wine in
the world, if you believe the Concil of Trent) very often
bears grapes with the <i>Acini</i>, or stones, of massy gold. I,
standing by my Ld., and by chance hearing him mention
the wine of this place, desir’d my Ld. to mention this story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to him, and I assure you he confirmed it to be very true,
but in a more modest way then we had heard it recounted
before: to wit, that the wine was very heavy, and sometimes
here and there will certainly be found in the grapes
a stone of pure gold, as he himself was presented with two
or three such grapes; for it seemes they can know which
are such grapes before they break them. Discoursing the
point, he defended the possibility of it, asking how pearles
sometimes are found in oysters, or little chalk stones in
gouty men’s hands, etc. My Ld. return’d his visit two
dayes after, and there remain’d a good correspondency
betwixt them ever after.</p>

<p><i>May 25th.</i> We went to see the cavalcade made in honour
of the young prince <i>Mustapha</i><a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> before his circumcision.
You must understand that when any great man’s son is to
be circumcised, a day or two before he shall be cut he is
caryed upon a horse up and down the town in triumph,
richly clad, but accompanied with severall other poor
youths or children, but finely drest, who count it an honour
to be circumcised at such a time. There goe a great
multitude with them, singing, dancing, shouting, and
Turkish Musick playes all the way before him. This
ceremony pay’d this day to the young prince was of this
nature, but performed in a Royall manner; for all the
Court of the G. Sigr. appeared, and we saw much of the
Glory of the Empire. All the great officers of State, as
likewise the Mustafaraca’s<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> (which are the <i>Lancie sperrate</i>,
the G. Signor’s life gard, for I was well acquainted with
one who was a Renegade) and other chief officers, had all
<i>chiaus</i> caps, as the Vizier himself, etc. They were most
excellently horsed, though now Amblers and middle-sized
horse are all in fashion. Most were in rich furre vests, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
outside cloth (it is a dishonor for great men to go without
a furre vest, though it be in the heat of summer); some the
outside silk, satin, velvet, cloth of gold and silver. The
horse-trappings extream rich; the buttock cloth embroyder’d
with gold, silver, pearles, etc., at the meanest
wrought with silk; the saddles in like manner; the stirrups,
many of silver, some guilded; the bridles plated with gold,
or silver and bras; and many set with good stones and
pearl, especially the peak on the forehead, and at each ear,
etc., this in general.</p>

<p>First come by severall companyes of Janizaryes, with
their Cherbigées or Colonells on foot. Then past the
Vizier’s pages in a company distinct and distant by themselves;
all very proper, stout men, in crimson velvet floured
<i>Delaman’s</i><a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> (they are exactly like our cassocks), with very
large silver gilt embost girdles. Then follow’d severall
companyes of more Janizaryes, with the Chiaus of the
Janizaryes on horseback in the reer, who had a girdle all
embroyder’d at least 1½ foot wide. After them, as many
more Janizaryes, with their Cherbigées on horse back.
Then as many more Janizaryes, with the Janizary Aga (a
devilish severe fellow, both in shew and in nature and
practice) in the reer of them on horseback. Then followed
another company of the Janizaryes, with the <i>Chiá</i>, (or you
may call him) Lieutenant to the Agà, who is their head.
One thing is remarkable, that whereas our swordmen never
goe in companys thus but armed, as if they were ready to
meet an enemy, here the devil of sword, gun, or weapon,
should you see. Some companyes of the Janizaryes had
each man a little switch or stick in his hand, the rest
nothing in the world about them; and in the whole cavalcade
not any armes in the world were ever seen, except a
cimeter and pole axe, which every horseman, let him be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
who he will (as I myself have had many times), wear, the
first fixt to his saddle under his left thigh, the latter to
the pummel over his right knee; and yet for all this
security there is no mutinying, no <i>embroglys</i> or tumults,
but the best government in the world. Next come severall
companyes of Armorers (Jebejées) in green caps, edged
with gold or silver, as their purses would beare; (chesmejées)
victuallers with red caps like Janizaryes, onely the
flap stands higher above the head piece. Then came
severall Cadyes<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and Cadeleschiérs (men of the Law), with
their <i>Naïps</i> or Secretaryes, or rather Scriveners. They
were all in a sort of sophisters (or lawyer’s) gown, without
a cape, short sleeves, and of severall colours and
stuffs, richer or baser according to their ability, silk, satin,
etc., all fur’d; these are Cadyes, captains, or <i>divan</i> habits.</p>

<p>Next followed the Vizier’s Guards in green vests and caps,
which differ’d much from what Consul Ricaut made them;
their vest was closed together with monstrous great buttons
and tassels; they were at least 300 lusty stout fellowes, all
<i>Albaneses</i>. After them came more of his pages clad like
the first. Then follow’d he himself, the <i>Mufti</i> and <i>Mosaïf</i>,
or great favorite; the Mufti in the midst, in a white cloth
vest and ermine furre; on his right hand the Vizier in a
white satin sable furr’d vest; on his left hand the <i>Mosaïf</i>
(or <i>Coologlan</i>), the favourite, in a green sattin sable vest.
Then were caryed by 40 <i>Naculs</i>, 20 on a side, which
are divices made upon a large pole in forme of a
pyramid or cone (rather) of wire, painted paper, beggars
batten (such as we trim hobbyhorses<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> withall), and flowrs
and fruit of wax work, and painted paper, etc. At
every wedding and circumcision such toys as these are
carryed before the partyes concerned; but these were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
large and costly. Then were carryed by two more <i>naculs</i>
of incredible bignesse; it was the most gaudy magnificent
peice of (Hobbyhorsism) folly that ever I saw. It was
continued in quite another kind of frolick upon a large
mast of a ship; it was 27 yards long, and the lower part
was 5 or 6 yards diameter; the ornaments of it were much
like this here described, onely between every sphere were
square cubes furnisht out with the same fancyes, especially
wax work. Now you will say: How could this colossus be
moved? At the bottom were eight or ten large bars of
wood fastend parallell (as the strings or bars of a sedane)
and betweene these were harnest above 100 slaves; and
before it (upon these bars) stood (or road) a master of a
galley, who menaged the Slaves, they resting and reering
it up and down at the noyse of his whistle. Now, for fear
it should overset and topple down, there were four long
pikes of wood fasten’d about half way up, and as many
ropes came from the top, by which other slaves (taking hold
of the lower end) guided the top and kept it alwayes right
up. To let these walking timber-trees pass by the streets
of the city many houses were untiled, and some in part
pul’d down. I went to view them whilst they were making.
They broke down a great stone wall of the publick <i>Cháne</i>
in which they were made to let them out. The story of the
walls of Troy and their Hobby-horse is to it as Tom thumb<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to Bevis of Southampton.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> I must here tell you a story.
The Vizier sent an expresse to the Bailo of Venice, commanding
him to send for all the actors of their operas to
come with their scœnes, musick, etc., to grace the G.
Signor’s solemnityes. The Bailo excused himself, urging it
was impossible (besides of the inconveniences, etc.) to bring
all that lumber and trumpery by land and Sea in due time.
The Chiaus (the messenger) storm’d and swore: what was
impossible for the G. Signor to do? <i>Walláh</i> (by G.), my
maister, if he will, can fetch your whole city hither just as
it stands there; streets, houses, churches, and all. The
Bailo, with much adoe, got of; but, ifaith, when I saw this
moving wooden steeple so easily menaged, I began to
think the <i>Chiaus</i> had some reason in him. The little
<i>naculs</i> were afterwards set before the G. Signor’s tents:
the two great ones before the Queen-mother’s Kiosk (or
sommer-house or Balcony), all in the place of sports, of
which more by and by. After these <i>Naculs</i> were past,
came young prince Mustapha, surrounded on every side
before and behind, with a brave troop of <i>Cherbigee</i>
(Collonels), all on foot, in their caps and feathers. The
prince himself was mounted upon a lovely beast, which was,
in a manner, nothing but jewels, pearls, gold, and silver
from head to tayle, and led by two mighty, lusty Cherbigées
richly clad, on each side one; two more in like
manner went fanning him all the way and shadowing him
(for it was about ten o’clock, and a most excessive hot day).
They have large fans made here on purpose for great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
personages of bustards’ feathers, contrived from 1½ to 2 or
3 foot wide. Whether it was by chance or on purpose, I
know not, but he made a stand just before us, where I view’d
him wel (as I have done oftentimes since), being within 3
yards of him at most, now I was about 5 yards distance.
He is in generall an ugly, il-favour’d (and I guesse very
ill-natured) chit; he hath a perfect Russe face (as I have
seen enough to be some competent judge) as may be; he
hath a beetle brow, a short, flat, saddled nose, with a
little cop<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> at the end; a roundish flat face, low forehead;
eyes and eyebrowes fair, the latter inclining to a sandy
colour; his eares very large, as much as can be seen; his
hands (as all Turkes are brutish and carelesse of them)
tan’d and swarthy. His mother is a Russe, and his father
of a Russe extraction. He had a plain Turbant on, like
a common Turk, and a black single feather on the left side,
at the bottom of which was a diamond of about 40 (or, as
they say, 43) <i>carats</i>, sent home from the K. of Persia of
old to a young prince of this Empire. He had likewise
two others, very large, on each side his vest, to clasp it
before, and instead of buttons were large pearls set al
down the edge. His Delamon under his vest was cover’d
all before (instead of buttons and loops) with broaches of
rubyes and Emeralds; his vest was a white cloth of silver
sables; his delamon purple cloth of gold. He road to his
father’s tent; there he was received with a kisse, and sat
down by him. After the young p. and his attendance
follow’d his Musick, Ten Pipers, 6 Drumes, 4 trumpets, 2
kettle-drumes, and 4 tamburs (or tympanums), like sives
cover’d with parchment at bottome; all these were mounted
on camels. The streets were lined with women on one
side and men on the other. The women of quality came
coached, and the chief had stands, or shops, or chambers,
on purpose provided. All were vailed, yet I took notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of many delicate persons that would now and then be
peeping, and some slipt down their vail very farre, which is
accounted (if observ’d by the rest) a great peice of impudence.
The streets were continually kept swept by broom
men that waited on purpose; and they were every foot and
anon between company and company refresht with water,
which <i>Sackals</i> (budget men<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>) brought and sprinkled on
purpose. Amongst so many people it was most wonderfull
to see order and strange silence, not the least rudenesse
in boyes or men; yet, to keep the crowd of people of and
in good order, there are men on purpose in all these public
meetings appointed, cal’d <i>Tooloonjés</i>, from skins of sheep
(cal’d Tooloons) blown up full of wind, and all dawb with
oil and tar, and in leather jackets besmeared in like
manner. The Turkes (who are very spruce and chary of
their fine vests) run from these people as from the Divel,
who upon occasion will strike them with their <i>tooloones</i>,
which will break no bones, but onely daub them; they
have leather caps with bells all down the side. There were
about 200 of these Raga-muffins, and their two Bashas, or
capes (heads), on horse back commanding them. In the
furniture and ornaments of men and horse that day
Diamonds, rubyes, emeralds, gold, silver, embroyder’d
work, etc., were common things. The slaves employ’d in
the <i>Naculs</i> before said had all their liberty. This day was
the 11th of their moon <i>Rebiul Evíl</i><a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> (or the first Evil), the
next being <i>Rebiul acker</i>. One thing I will here conclude
this paragraph withall. You can imagine what strange
prodigious civility all Franks (as they call us) found everywhere
at these festivals. I have been twenty times myself
caryed in to see the sights, when all Turkes have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
huncht<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> away. They took the greatest pride that we should
see and (at least seem to) admire everything. I have been
many times very, very near the G. Signor himself (sometimes
½ an hour together, as long as I pleased), with my
hat and in my hair, both which they hate as the Divel;
and have return’d quite through the City (once or twice al
alone) in the midst of the great multitude of Turkes, and
yet I assure you I never met the least affront in the world,
but rather extraordinary kindnesse, as shall be hinted particularly
afterwards; and amongst these vast multitudes
all are as husht and orderly as we are at a sermon. I
could not possibly believe it till I found it alwayes so, and
from me you may believe this wonder.</p>

<p><i>May 27th</i>, and the 13th of their Moon, is Mahomet’s
birth day, which they solemnly kept, for they have severall
holy dayes as well as we, besides <i>Biráms</i>, etc. This day
the G. Signor went to Sultan Selim’s Mosch (which is the
chief Mosch here); we went to see him go by. There was
no great state or train; most of the great men came
scattering. The Vizier came riding by himself, with about
20 or 30 of his pages before him in crimson velvet (as
before is described), on foot before him, and about 8 persons
on horseback about him; to wit, his <i>Kihiá</i> (or deputy
or steward properly), his <i>Agá</i>, or chief Governor of his
household, etc. The Vizier<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> was very plain, his vest green
cloth, with ermin’s furre, and, a distance being kept between
his pages before and his attendants behind, he rode
alone in the middle. About an hour after (it was near
11 o’clock) came riding in front about 10 <i>Bostanjés</i> to se the
street clear’d and water’d, as before is said; they speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
rode back again and joyn’d with their company, who made
up about 50 in all. After them follow’d the G. Signor’s
pages on each side the way, in cloth of gold, dark sky-colour’d
<i>delamons</i>, with broad embroyder’d girdles, and
every one a <i>jint</i> (or small javelin) in his hand of black
ebony inlaid with mother of pearl; all were on foot in two
files, about 60 in all. Immediately followed the G. Signor
himself, very plain, in an ordinary <i>sarick</i>, or <i>shash</i> (<i>his
Tiara</i>), and purple <i>cáook</i> (his scul-cap, about which his
shash is wound). His vest was very plain likewise, onely
two good large stones were set in brocades to clasp it
above before; the two tips at the bottom before were born
up by two footmen, and his garments underneath were
very ordinary as might be. I have seen him many, many
times (as is said before); but take this little description of
him once for all. He is a very swarthy man, his face
shining, and pretty full eye, black and sparkling; his nose
something long, and beetled<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> at the end, a full, roundish
high forehead, a severe brow, his beard black, very thin,
and not very long. The Vizier’s beard is much thicker, but
they say he does not wear it longer than the G. Signor’s;
his hand big, but very rude, <i>alla Turchesa</i>; the upper part
of his face something resemble Mahomet the 1st in
<i>Knowles</i>.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> He hath a great deal of Majesty in his countenance,
and terror, too, when he please to put it on. He
hath been very lean and sickly (3 or 4 yeares since), but
now he is exceedingly plump and hearty. I have been
certainly informed by <i>Grerách basha</i> (a Renegado, and his
cheif Chirurgion, who circumcised the young prince, as by
and by you shall hear more), with whome I was well
acquainted, that the onely Physick (in a manner) which he
used was Issues (whereof he hath had 8, nay 10, at a time
upon him) (they are much used by all people here, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in the Plague) and exercise, especially hunting,<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> which he
followes still most extravagantly, many times going out
two or three houres before day, and it may be not returning
till as late at night; sometimes (as this last winter)
summoning in all the <i>Villánes</i> in 20 mile compasse to
drive a whole wood or forest before them. They tell a
good story of him (but I have also heard it of one of his
ancestors), that many of the poor <i>Villánes</i> dying once for
hunger and cold, the <i>Bostanjé Basha</i>, or some other
officer, caused 8 or 10 of their bodyes to be laid in the way
where the G. Signor was to passe. The G. S. seeing them,
askt what they were; the officer told him Poor Villánes
starved and perisht in his service, adding what pitty it was,
etc. The G. S. immediately swore they were all rotten,
and he would hang him for providing noe sound men, so
his pitty had like to have cost him his head. Pardon this
digression: now we return to the story.</p>

<p>Just after the G. Signor followed the young P. Mustapha,
very plain likewise, with two servants on horseback
attending, on each side one; after followed several
Bashaes and other great men, all in plain clothes.
There was a Sermon there, and prayers (as is usual);
and after 2½ houres all returned. The young prince
with his father went to the Seraglio, and about Kindí
(the 9th houre in the Turkish account of the day),
he was circumcised by the Chirurgion above said (whose
new Turkish name is <i>Onufé</i>), who had for his paines
10,000 zechines (about 6,200 lb. sterling), as he boasted
to me; but I am confident it was much lesse. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
presented him from the Q. mother in a large silver
bason. He was an Italian, ignorant enough, but bold and
ingenious. As at other circumcisions (as is before hinted),
many accompany the great man’s son, and take it as an
honour, so here were severall 1,000es circumcised at this
feast; an account see afterwards amongst the generall
notions. I now will begin with the festivalls in honour of
the circumcision, which began May 15th, they counting it
the first day of the moon (from the <i>Phases</i>), whereas to us
the day before was our new moon, which they reckoned
the 29th, but in reality was the 28th, on which night the
rising in a little thin cloud appear’d bigger then ordinary,
and gave them the greatest pleasure and occasion of rejoicing
that could be.</p>

<p>After these solemnityes were past, in the beginning of
the next moone (June the 14th) began the solemnityes of
the Mariage of the Mosaifs (the bridegroomes) house, of
which in good order. First, then, you must know that
going into the Seraglio here there are two buildings which
meet at the great gate almost at right angles, before which
lyes a delicate plain, wherein they had pitch’t these Tents
so in a rank as to make up a third side, and inclose
between the two former walls and the tents a large quadrangle,
which they left open on the 4th side for people to
come and be spectators. Here every night come the G.
Signor and the Prince, the Sultana and ladyes, and all the
court to their proper places to see the sights. The
company never come together till about 2 o’clock after
dinner; for, setting up and spending all the night in revellings,
the forenoon went to recruit them in sleep. About
Kindí (which is the 9th hour) were brought presents to the
G. Sr. dayly; for all great men throughout his whole
empire were compel’d to present him and the sultana: and
many about the Court not giving so liberally as was expected,
were forced to second presents; some were <i>manzoold</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
(turn’d out) for their niggardlinesse. It is commonly
reported that the cost of all these sports, etc., come to
12,000 purses of money, whereas his presents come to at
least 32,000 purses, each purse being 500 doll.; so he
gain’d 20,000 purses, or 10,000,000 dollars, which, at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
the dollar, makes 2,250,000 lb. sterling. These presents
were carried by publickly to the G. Sr. tent, and there the
chief of those that brought them were vested by the G. Sr.,
as is said in our audience with the Vizier. When these
presents did not come by there was continuall dancing or
variety of sports, either before the G. Sr., Vizier, Sultana,
etc., some or other, all the afternoon, of which by and by
more particularly. About a full hour before sunset (sometimes
sooner) were brought into the ring every day many,
many young lads to be circumcised in honour of the G.
Prince, or, rather, the honour was their own in being his
companions; and every one has a pension as long as he
lives of a certain number of aspers (I heard 3 named, but
that is too little) per diem, and are call’d the Prince’s
pensioners. This circumcision last 13 dayes, till the P.
was cut. That night the G. Sr. and Sultana stay’d within
to comfort him, yet we had the old sports before the G.
Viz. and Testerdare,<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> etc. At the time abovesaid all the
persons to be cut that day were brought round the ring,
singing a Turkish song, being onely some words of the
Al Koran, and rejoycing with musick and clapping of their
hands; then they were brought to the tent, where they
were cut publickly. I saw many 100es of them (there
being about 2,000 in all the 13 nights) cut, and the Turkes
would be so farre from hindring your seing, as they would
make way for you. There were many of riper yeares,
especially renegades that turn’d Turks. I saw an old man
which they reported to be 53 yeares old, cut. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
common way there of turning was (as I saw severall) to go
before the G. Sr. and Vizier, and throw down their cap, or
hold up their right hand or forefinger; then they were
immediately led away by an officer (who stands by on
purpose), and cut with the rest. I saw a Russe of about
20 yeares old, who, after he had been before the Vizier,
came to the tent skipping and rejoicing excessively; yet,
in cutting he frowned (as many of riper ages doe). One
night we met a young lad, who askt us the way to the
Vizier. Being a country boy, we askt him what he would
with him. He told us his brother turn’d Turk, and he
would goe find him, and be cut, too; and two dayes after
he was as good as his word. It is very dangerous meddling
in these cases here. There were at least 200 proselytes
made in these 13 days. It is our shame, for I believe all
Europe have not gained so many Turkes to us these 200
yeares; for, though the Ch. of Rome boast their
Emissaryes here (as, indeed, there are many, many), Jesuits,
Dominicans, Franciscans, yet, believe me, they have other
designes than converting of Turkes.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p>There was constantly a Mezin<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> (or cryer, or steeple man),
which call’d to prayers from behind the G. Sr.’s tent, as I
thought, out of the Seraglio. Besides those who call to prayers
upon every steeple, every great man (as the Kaimachan
Bostangebasha, etc., at Stamboul) has his Mezin, and by
consequence the G. Sr. must have his. Then, indeed, it
was wonderfull to see with what reverence, uniformity, and
most admirable devotion all (especially the men of note)
betook themselves to their prayers in publick; the chief men
in their stands and tents, the others (everywhere round
the ring), 20 or 30, or more or lesse, in companys abroad
upon carpets or the bare ground. We were permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to stand by without the least disturbance. I had seen
their manner before, and have all their prayers (which are
in Arab) by me. Sometimes they stand, sometimes kneel,
oftentimes bowing their head to the very ground and
kissing it. I was once within 5 yards of the G. Sr. all the
time.</p>

<p>There is in all <i>Mosches</i>, and in most great men’s
houses, and was here likewise in the G. Sr.’s and others
tents, a <i>Imaun</i> (Imam), or learned man (for they have no
such thing as orders or distinction between clergy and
laity), who did <i>praise</i>, or rather speak out the prayers, the
rest keeping a profound silence and imitating him in their
bowings and postures. I should heartily have commended
their piety, had I not seen in the very same place all the
roguery and beastliness, and the like, acted there publickly
with the applause and approbation of the chief men
amongst them as well as the rabble: as shall be by and
bye recounted. Devotion being ended, which never lasted
above ¼ of an hour, imediately strike up the <i>Capagasi’s</i>
musick (the head of the white Eunuches), and the Capigé
basha’s musick.</p>

<p>The G. Sr., Vizier, Kaimachans, etc., musick is all alike.
1st, there are trumpets, which come in onely now and then
to squeel out a loud note or two, but never play a whole
tune. 2d, pipers—their pipe is much the same with our
trebble shaurne<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> or Hoóboy; these play continually without
any pause. 3d, great drums, but not bract<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> as oures,
nor corded at the bottom; they beat them at both ends,
the top with the right hand with a great stick at every
long or leading note, the bottom with a little in their left
hand at every small or passing note; these have their
pauses often. 4thly, little kettle or dish drums (for they
have both) dissonant one to the other, for they are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
paires; these rest sometime likewise. 5thly, they have
2 brasse platters about foot wide, which they hang loose in
their hands, and clatter them one against the other.</p>

<p>I am very inclinable to believe all this Musick old, and
mention’d in Scripture. These last either were the cymbals
mention’d in Chron. 15, 19. At the sounding of the
Musick above 200 Mestejés (or firemen) came from the
G. Sr.’s stables (which were hard by) into the Ring, bearing
their Beacons upon their shouldjers, and singing all the
way a prayer for the G. Sr. in such a dismal tone, which,
with the noyse of the musick before named, and all the
lights and fires, and the black <i>Tooloonjés</i> muving up and
down, gave me the perfectest representation of Hell that
ever I yet saw upon earth; yet the Turkes count it a
heavenly thing. I do verily believe our custome of pulling
of our hat, and bidding good evening at lighting up, or
bringing in of the first lights or candles (as like wise all
Greekes, Jewes, Armenians, and the Italians here give the
<i>buona sera</i> at the first light), was a very antient custome all
over the East, and this prayer of the Mestejés is nothing
else. They set their lights round the ring and tend them
with fuell. Those before the Sultana, G. Sr., Vizier, etc.,
wer 6 or 8 branches upon the same stalk; the others were
single. This shewes you something to conceive the double
ones by. There were about 200 <i>Tooloonjés</i> to keep of the
rabble, continually waiting; and though they suffer’d no
Turke to go in, yet we could passe and repasse without
the least difficulty imaginable. All the lights placed and
orderd, besides the light of the moon assisting, the sports
and dances begin afresh, which continued commonly till
midnight; sometimes much longer, seldome lesse.</p>

<p>On May the 21st was nothing to doe, for just about sun
set was such a terrible <i>Burasca</i> of wind, thunder, lightning,
rain, and hail (very great) mixt together, as almost blew
down their tents, beat out all their lamps, and spoil’d all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
their machines, and the sand, which is round the city in
many beds before the rain, was roused in such a prodigious
manner, as being that night on horseback I could
not see his head; it was a perfect Ægyptian mist of dust.
The G. Sr., Vizier, and all the company were forced to
retire for that night.</p>

<p>After these dances and sports were over, about midnight
(as is said), began very excellent fireworks of all sorts,
which continued till towards morning, and then all retired
to their repose. Now for the dances and sports. You
must understand that from all parts of the Empire were
summon’d all (his subjects), Jewes, Greekes, Arabs, Armenians,
Turkes, etc., that were any wayes excellent for any
sports or entertainments of delight, and truly I do not
believe these Eastern Countryes can afford any thing more
in that kind then what I have seen here. First, your
dancers were for the most part young youths, very handsome
generally; most Greekes, yet some more Turkes,
Armenians, and a few Jewes.</p>

<p>The best were clothed very rich, either cloth of gold,
silver, or rich silk. They had on a <i>just a corp</i>, as we say,
coming to mid thigh, close button’d at the hands, and girt
about them with rich girdles as their purse and fancy led
them; under it (over the rest of their cloth’s) they had a
petticoat, which was very large, and hang’d very full, down
to their ankles; this was very rich, and of some pretty light
merry colour. These clothes were given them by the
G. Sr., or Sultana. Their heads are not shaven quite close,
but very lovely locks are left round, which at other times
they wear up close, and are unseen; but now they let them
down, and set them out to best advantage, sometimes
disshevel’d all about their shoulders, sometimes braided
and hanging at their back. They commonly wore over
their hair a plain cap of silk (small, or scull fashion’d) or
(which is more gentele) a fur’d sort of cap, cal’d here a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
<i>culpáck</i>. There was a delicate lovely boy, of about 10
yeares old, had as comely head of hair, long as most
women. With him danc’t a lusty handsome man (about
25), both Turkes. They acceded all the roguish lascivious
postures conceivable with that strange ingenuity of silent
ribaldry, as I protest I believe Sardanapalus and all the
effeminate courts of the East never came near them. They
pleased so extremely that there was scarce a night but
they acted in some place or other. I saw them severall
times before the Sultana doe as much as anywhere else.
The rest danc’t 4, 6, sometimes 8 in a company. It consists
most in wriggling the body (a confounded wanton
posture, and speakes as much of the Eastern treachery as
dumb signs can), slipping their steps round gently; setting
and turning. Never is their arming, or any figure, or
handing; yet one night before the Sultana they danc’t in
hats and perukes, and Frank habit, but could not imitate
us in anything. I never saw them a second time, which
makes me believe they did not please. They allwayes
come before the person (where they dance) running (as all
other that have occasion to passe and re-passe, unlesse in
the bringing of presents or the like solemnity); then
they fall either into a semicircle or whole round, and so
continue falling out of one tune and humour into another,
till at last, with a merry wherry of their musick, they
turn round (as the Dervises) a long time, and so stopping
they bow, and away they run to their musick, which
are alwayes hard by. These differ from the other
Musicianers, and may be cal’d the private musick, being
commonly Pans pipe of 20, 25, 30, (at most) 32 reeds,
placed in order, lesse and shorter each than another as the
notes rise. I have heard it plai’d on three or four times
since I came into Turkey, and fancy it certainly to be the
most enravishing tone in nature; yet the notes are fixt,
and cannot be alter’d flat and sharp <i>ad libitum</i>, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
cannot be brought into the canon of musick to play
anything that is appropriated to some peculiar lessons.
2d, a little pittifull instrument with three wire strings,
which every fellow thrums ordinarily about the street. I
take it to be the <i>Pandura</i> of the antients.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> 3rdly, Turkish
and Arab lutes of 5, 8, sometimes but 4, double strings,
with a little neck a yard (the least), sometimes more, long.
They have severall sorts of them—all not worth a lowse.
4, a sort of Dulcimer with gut strings, touch’t with both
hands, as the Harp, onely this lyes flat and Horizontall.
The Jewes have a kind of fiddle of 4 guts, tuned like a
violin, but (that you may know the excellency of it) the
back and sides are commonly made of the bottome of a
gourd, the belly of a dryed film, or skin <i>hornifyed</i><a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>; the
neck is of a piece of broom stick. Lastly, to crown the
Consort, you have every where a <i>Tambúr</i>, of which something
is said above, is well known in Italy. These
minstrells set all down crosse leg at a convenient distance
on the one side of the persons before whome they plaid.
The dancers have in each hand two peices of Ebony, 3 or
4 inches long, which they knock and charre together in
time to the musick. I fancy they are every whit as good
as our castenettas. They call them in Turkish <i>chalparéh</i>,
in Greek παιξάρι. Next there were many actors of little
playes or interludes; all in the most beastly brutish
language possible, as I was sufficiently informed by my
companions, and there actions fully confirmed it. The
actors of men were Armenians and Turkes that came from
the borders of Persia, and several times acted certain conceits
in Persian habit, which was very becoming, being far
more rich and gaudy then the Turkes wear. They often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
mix, as is said, severall sorts of beasts in their gambals,
and in every play alwayes enter’d in a large Dear (like
our hobby horses), whome they call’d <i>Hóo</i>, which is a
name of God; but there it stood for a Robin good fellow,
or hobgoblin, pulling them, and biting them, and playing
a 1,000 freakes. In sume, the best of them did not
exceed our ordinary Christmasse gambals.</p>

<p>There was one acted there very often not much unlike
<i>the old man with 7 Sons, so good, so good</i>. They acted two
drunken men, two young whores, and an old baud, and a
gallant, and a souldjer; a cuckold and his three wives;
wherein all the tricks and wayes of making love here in
Turkey, and the extreame jealously and severity of these
people were excellently well expresst. They acted a
horse courser, a barbier, a butcher, and several such conceits.
In Persian habit, with every one his plume of
feathers in his <i>Turbant</i>, they acted an humour which
pleased mightily. They begin in a ring, and what the
cheif does all the rest are to imitate, or run the gantlet.
If he turnes to the right, left, forward, or round, sculk
down, start up, etc., they immediately do the like. Such
pour pastorals we had in great variety, and they passe here
for greater ingenuity than your playes can doe in England.
Their tiring place is alwayes behind the Musick a convenient
distance, from which and to which they alwayes
passe and re-passe running, as before is said of the dancers.</p>

<p>Next I must recount the Maisters of activity. First
there was a <i>bastanjé</i>, a middle-sized squad fellow, who shew
a vast strength in tossing about weights. Upon sticks or
steales,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> about 4 foot long, were fasten’d at the end round
stones, each weighing from 26 pound to 50 pound a piece.
Beginning with the least first, he would take in each hand
one, and swing them about his head, under his armes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
behind his back, over his shoulders, many strange wayes
with the greatest dexterity and agility imaginable; then
setting down them, he would take the two next, and so
change on till he come to the last, which (as is said)
weighed at least 50 pound apeice; yet he would tosse them
about with ease, even to admiration. Some of these he
would hold steady and strong at his armes end. Having
laid them by, he began with single ones of like fabrick,
but weighing from 60 lb. to 120 lb. a peice, being equall to
our hundred weight. Fastning the steel or handle to his
wrist with a leather thong, he managed all the smaller first
in like manner with one hand, still rising till he came to
the greatest, which to my amazement he tost about likewise.
He had others with a vast piece of iron at the end
loose, so as lifting up the steal it would slip to the handle;
thence he would throw it out to the end again with a great
slap or crack. These he first managed likewise double,
then single; but they were not so heavy; the biggest of
these weigh’d not above 50 or 90 lb. at most. Lastly, he
had a round stone weighing a Kintal<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> and half, just our
hundred and half, fixt or hang’d to two steales with two
short chaines; this would he tosse about at a strange rate,
swinging it behind his back, his head being between the
sticks and his armes. His right arme was alwayes braced
with a fillet very hard and close above the elbow. There
are many of these stone balls (or shot) with Iron steales or
handles in many places here hanged up, at which I have
many times wonder’d, the Turkes telling ridiculous fables
concerning them. There are two by the great <i>Bagno</i> in
<i>Scutary</i>, and severall hang’d up over severall gates in
Stambol with Turkish writing ingraved upon them, yet
none of them exceeded (if they any wayes can equall)
these which this fellow plaid withall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>I made an exact enquiry since I came home, and understand
that these here at Stambol have been in like manner
menaged,<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and the writings speak by whome and before
whome it was done, as particularly one of them over
Adrianople gate (in Stambol) was menaged just before
Mahomet 3d, who took the City, and being infinitely
pleased with the strength and activity of the man (whome
report made a Bulgarian), he rewarded the man well, and
caused the stone ball with the Iron in it to be chain’d up
there in memory of him. Some of these in Stambol have a
crosse peice of Iron at top, which make me inclinable to
believe that the Greek Emperors had this sport before,
and the Turkes learn’d it from them. There were vaulters
there good store; but, indeed, I think we out doe them all.</p>

<p>This Bustanjé would do prettily well. I see him stand
upon the edge of two Cimeters (each foot upon one) barefoot,
and swing about one of his greater single stones
without the least harme. There was an Arab likewise
would lay his bare back upon one, and at the same time a
great, lusty man stood on his belly, as likewise he would
heave on 2 or 3 vast great stones by the help of a pulley, and
yet his back never was hurt. I confesse to read this story
in Busbequius made me amazed (as this may you); but
when I saw the height of it, I counted it a poor thing;
for by his buttocks, and his head, neck, and shoulders, he
bore up his belly so as the cimiter lay under the hollow of
his back, and a strong man may easily bear a vast weight
in that posture. The same man took the Cimiter with his
hands at each end, and, laying the edge to his bare belly,
moved it very hard from right to left without any harme,
onely making a little red line where the edge past. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
would fasten a pulley to a gibbet, and through ran a rope,
fastend at one end to a ring, to which all his hair was tyed
at the crown of his head; the other end was in his hand,
by which he would pull himself up a great height. Sometimes
he did it with another man at his back; once with
an Asse fastend to his shoulder; once with a young camel.
I have made some conjectures upon it, but I will not
anticipate your mechanicks about this φαινόμενον, onely
tell you it seems a pretty one. He took a great pole,
about 3 yards long and ½ foot thick, but broader at each
end, and setting one end upon the teeth of his lower jaw,
he danct with it in this posture upright without touching
it, but clapping his hands to his musick, by then he
put another frame upon it with 8 or 10 branches (or he
could adde more) upon it by a hole that was in the top.
Upon every stanza he would set a cup of water; then
raysing it, he would dance with all these in like manner
without spilling one drop. Then by a stick, which he
would put into the same hole, he set a little boy crosse-leg’d
upon it, and danct with him in like manner. Lastly,
he would set a great pitcher of water up on the upper end,
and dance with it; then all of a sudden, with great force,
he would strike away the end at his mouth from him, and
catch the pitcher in his armes. We saw most of these
tricks upon the road acted by him, and all again repeated
in the Ring.</p>

<p>Some yeares since there was an Arab at Smyrna did
all these tricks much more dexterously; instead of a
pitcher of water, he would lay a little child flat on its back
upon the upper end, and bidding it shut its eyes, would
dance with it a little while, and at last, striking away the
pole, would catch it in his armes safely. He likewise
would place a <i>handjar</i>, or Turkish dagger, ¾ foot long,
upon the ground, with the poynt upwards; he layes himself
on his back with his head close to it, then raysing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
his heeles, and his body poysed, his body upon his head
and neck, and then with a jerk would turne himself quite
to the other side the dagger without the least harme.
This fellow did the like, but more bunglingly. The
Smyrna man would likewise place three swords with their
points upwards, and upon them a little piece of dirt or
such a thing; then fetching a run, he would passe them on
the ayre, striking of the pieces of dirt, and with the fourth
step come to the ground. This logger-head did not doe
it, though he said he could.</p>

<p>Jugglers were many likewise, but the generality were
loggerheads to what we have in England. There was
one, an Arab, so ill-looking a fellow as you would have
sworne that he was elder brother to the Divel himself.
His face exceeding black and shriveled much (for he was
old), blear-eyed, his head bald and shined like soot, being
well baked in the sun; he had short, crisp’d hair, black
and massy (like a black moor) round about like the Corona
of the fryars; and he was accordingly clad just like a
Dominican in a white serge vest or gown closed before,
with open sleeves covered with another black one like it
in all things, excepting that it was not closed before.</p>

<p>The common people here are the most superstitious,
credulous, fabulous creatures alive. I speak of all Turkes,
Greekes, etc., and this man by his lookes, and garb, and
tricks had so imposed upon them as severall had represented
him to me as if he had been one of the old Magicians
in Ægypt risen from Gehenna. I was big with
desire and expectation of seeing him, for he seldome
(as the best of his jibes being common) shew’d his tricks
publickly. At last I laid out for him, and he was brought
to my Ld. He shew’d little then, but I saw all he could
do afterwards, which truely was not much, and being so
old, he slubber’d<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> his businesses over so as I could discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
all he did. He had 5 or six snakes tam’d, which were kept
under the white frock, and with these he would make good
sport. He would pull one from your buttons, nose, bosome,
etc., and taking any thing of the standers by, as knives,
handkerchiefs, bals, etc.; going to returne them, he would
drop you a snake. Now, no people in the world being
more fearfull of such things then these, he past for such a
miracle-monger amongst them as I fear they of Ægypt
were little better, especially considering how highly his
conceits might be improved; for here are dayly snakes
carryed up and down, tamed, of all sizes almost, and I did
not question amongst the vulgar even in England to make
thousands of them believe I could turn almost anything into
them by sleight of hand, with a little thought and practice.
By help of his under frock (closed before, and with wide
sleeves), with his left hand he could give and take anything
from his right hand unseen; by which he made
many pretty conveighances, though none very fine. Had
you heard the relations of the people (some understanding
men), you would not wonder at my relation to you. One
came and swore to me that he pul’d a snake a yard long
out of his nose; another that he put a little small ball
under a cup, and it was turn’d into a serpent; another gave
him a cup of wine, and he drank and return’d the cup, and
going to fill one more for himself, swore there leapt out a
great snake, etc. I got so much liberty as to see all his
contrivances under his frock, which are too tedious to be
repeated.</p>

<p>I saw another which thrust a Iron (which I had in my
hand all the time, and it was really done) about 10 inches
(at the least) long in to his nose, up to the hilt, and may
easily be done with a little practice by anybody. Many more
such tricks I have to communicate to you when we meet.</p>

<p>There was wrastling every day, according to the old way,
which is yet peremptorily retain’d. They are naked, all
but a short pair of drawers put over their middle. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
is nothing of play, but onely meer strength required.
Nothing is accounted of unless the vanquished person be
laid flat on his back, and therefore they fall worrying
and tumbling on the ground perhaps 1½ hour till one be
rowled on his back. Many come in oyl’d all over, that no
man’s hand could hold fast any part of them, and therefore
the wrist, or ham, or ancle, if they can be grasped, are
the onely places of laying good hold. It is well pictur’d
in a late author (Potinus), treating of medals, but it is nasty
sport at best.</p>

<p>About mid-night, as is said, all the dances and other
sports being over, began the fireworks, which, indeed,
very much delighted me. The chief contrivers were two
(a Venetian and Dutch) Renegadoes, there being appointed
all materials in a large Cháne, and at least 200
stones to beat and prepare their compositions. First there
were several figures of monstrous giants, many-headed and
deformed. They were hollow’d and framed with little
hoopes, and paper’d over. These were hang’d all over
with crackers, serpents, sausissons,<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> etc., and after these were
fired (which alwayes was done with excellent time), out of
their heads, and Eyes, nose, eares, flew severall rockets, and,
last, out of their mouths gushed streams of fire. Some had
charges in their hands, which fired in the last place, and
the armes being continued loose, swung them about very
dexterously. Severall of these machines were contrived
to turn upon the pole or spindle on which they hung, and
were caryed round by a blind rocket attacht to the hem of
their garments, for you saw no legs—nothing but a long
coat cover’d their lower part. What was burnt of the
frame was infallibly repair’d by next night.</p>

<p>Next there were Pyramids (slightly framed, all to be
caryed and recarryed dayly, which was done by Slaves) of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
at least 10 or 12 yards high, hang’d in like manner with
fireworks all over, and after they fired, remain’d upon the
sides little cotton stoups<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> innumerable, which, being prepared
with a composition of camphore, etc., burnt a full
quarter of an hour after the others were past, like so many
pure white flames or tapers, in due rank and file from
bottom to top. At last, from the top, flew a volley of
rockets, crackers, and other wild fire altogether, with very
wonderfull delight.</p>

<p>There were contrived severall trees (as I may call them),
or stands branched and hollowed, and filled with a nimble
composition which gave fire from bottom to top to severall
canes attach’t to the sides (at holes on purpose) and
charg’d variously with all manner of fire workes. Coming
into the branches were discharg’d severall hundred of them
together. There were severall large paste boarded castles,
charged within and without with the like workes, which
discharg’d in like manner. There was a high, large fountain,
which, when it had discharg’d all his fire-workes, left
four double rowes (at convenient distance) of pipes, which
cast out streames and drops of fire in exact resemblance
of the naturall fountaines of water; and, at the top, four
large pipes, and, in the middle of them, a fift, very big, all
which cast streames of fire (which was whiten’d with
Camphora) upward. It dured a long time, and ended
with a volley of rockets, discharged all at once into the
ayre. There was a round fountain, contrived to move
upon the pin or staff (on which the whole machine
hang’d), in 4 or 5 peices, which, by blind rockets attacht
to them, moved contrary wayes, though at a distance they
all seemed to move the same way, the angles in the eye
being the same. In all things else it was like the former
fountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>There was (May 28th) a very large castle brought forth,
intended to represent the castle at Candia. After an infinite
of fireworkes discharg’d from it, and God knowes how
many guns fired from within (by men on purpose, who
withdrew afterwards at a port hole), it took fire at last (designedly)
in so admirable a manner as no naturall fire could
seem more reall. The combustible matter was made with
so exquisite a composition, and the ribs so well contrived,
as though the flame burst out in many places about the
bottom of the roof; yet the top took fire in due time and
burnt with the body, and dropt down first peice by peice.
Then the sides began to let the fire break out through
them, and by little and little the top parts of them fell down
first, and then the wals wasted in order, till all was dropt
down in one heap of fire. All this was done with that
leisure, as it lasted at least an hour, and made the goodlyest
bonefire that ever I saw.</p>

<p>There was severall men with hobby horses about them,
and other figures, cover’d all over in like manner with fireworkes,
which taking fire, ran up and down and encounter’d
one another bravely. There were great timbers placed up
like gallowes, and to one another were fasten’d ropes in
such a manner as upon them were hang’d little ships,
galleyes, etc., able to hold two or three men (but many,
many made of paper, and the like stuff, represented a
whole ship’s crew), who managed the guns and fireworkes
within, contrived most dexterously; and with other ropes
pulling these vessels backwards and forwards, they represented
a sea-fight very naturally. One was betwixt Capt.
Georgio’s ship (a famous <i>corsair</i>, about 10 yeares since
taken by them) and two galleyes. It was late every night
before this trade of fire was over, but then for an hour,
some times, it was a great deal more. The <i>Mestegées</i> from
all quarters of the Ring, at their fires, fir’d severall
thousands of rockets (especiall 28th of May, the last night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
but one, and the best), which certainly are the best fireworkes
to behold in Nature. Some of them discharg’d
about 30 starres, and as many little camphire bals of pure
white fire. There was a sort (which I confesse I doe not
understand well) which flew up all wayes without any fuse,
but onely one visible dull coal (as it were), till they broke
aloft and discharg’d their starres, and with a great report,
as many of the others likewise did. All these, when they
were discharg’d, were levell’d to fly over the people’s side;
for at the festivalls at the birth of this prince, a Jew (that
made the fireworkes) shot one large rocket towards the
Kiosk, designing to have mounted it over, but it chanced
to fly right into the Kuzler agà’s<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> lap, and burnt up all (if
any little was left). The poor Jew was first drub’d 150
drubs on his feet, but the black devil, the gelding, would
not rest satisfied with that, but got him cut of.</p>

<p>All these were shown the (28th May), but every other
night we had enough, though not such variety. There
were several Iron charges much like the chambers of
<i>Pettarders</i>,<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> but farre bigger and longer. These were
fasten’d into the ground fill’d with a slow composition,
which being fir’d, cast up one continuall stream of fire (with
dreadfull noyse) at least 20 yards high into the Ayre. The
first night I went to see them on horseback, being caryed
by an Italian Count (his name formerly Bocareschi), now
a <i>lancia sperrata</i> to the G. Sr., with whome I had the luck
to be very well acquainted some yeares agoe. He was
infinitely civill to me (though a damned rogue all along,
and I was alwayes aware of him), yet I shall tell you of
him more by and by. He caryed me (being on horseback
himself) between the G. Sr.’s and Vizier’s tents within 8
yards of either of them (at severall times), without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
least molestation or difficulty. I was round with him in
twenty companyes of Turkes, and houses and places; but
that is not now to be insisted on.</p>

<p>When the lights began, I and he went on the People’s side,
where were many more horsemen besides. My horse
snorted and trembled, so I suspected no good, yet I was
resolved to stay and see all. Just as the fireworkes began,
he and many other horses by, ran mad, and rising up
fell on his hams, then, trembling, on his side, fairly layd
along and run away as if the Divel had drove him. I
was getting up, but seeing many, many mad Jades coming,
I fell flat on my face, and committed the event to God.
His name be ever praised! for though I dare sware at
least 100 horse and people came over me, I got not the
least harm imaginable in the world.</p>

<p>You must understand this Bocareschi was a very parasite
as lived, an excellent wit, and some little learning, the
Latin toung perfectly; but for his damned traiterous perfidious
tricks, was kick’t out of all publick ministers’ companyes.
And for my own part I knew him well, but
caressed him onely to make my ends of him at this time;
which I did, for he had come and made a little interest here
with my Ld. and Sir Tho. Baines. We went for Adrianople,
and there he come almost every day, and eat and
drank wine with us. Now he kept alwayes fair with me,
for fear I might doe him some discourtesy. I alwayes gave
him good words, though in good earnest every one else
hated him. That you may see once for all what a beast he
was, he came and eat and drink at my Ld.’s Table with
the Plague upon him twice, and at last dyed of it, within 8
houres after he went from us.</p>

<p>I was with the Ragusean Embassr. (as is said) several
times to see the sights. We alwayes had a cherbigee or two
that look’t after us, and would not suffer the greatest Turk
whatever to molest us; but we sat on a cushion with
bolsters and cushions, very near the Vizier’s tent. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<i>Bocareschi</i> had promis’d to shew Sr. Th. B. the sights
(for my Lord never saw anything). One night he came
with some servants, and one or two of the nation with
him. <i>Bocareschi</i> seing the Embassdr. of Ragusia there
placed (with whome I was at that time present), out of a
pico (for the Embassr. hated him to death, and had
affronted him highly) brought in Sr. Tho. B. and his
company, and placed him just before us. The Embr. was
divilishly displeased at it, as likewise the Turkes that
waited on him. But <i>Bocareschi</i>, being a Metafaraca,<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> would
not make any stirre, but came and desir’d the Embr. and
us to rise, and so removed us to a better place, just under
the G. Vizier’s tent, where we rested in spight of him, till all
was done. The Vizier wears severall caps (as is before
mention’d). Once I saw him at the sights in one which
they tell me is used in time of warre, but he soon chang’d
it for a common one. As for all sorts of rope dancers,
here were the best in the world.</p>

<p><i>June 10th.</i> The present of Cool-oglan (the <i>Mosaïf</i> or
favourite), the bridegroome, was carryed by; we went to see
it. First went by severall companyes of janissaries with
their cherbigées, then many more with their chief officers.
The jannisary <i>Aga</i> in cloth of gold, the <i>Chia beghi</i><a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> in
green velvet, the <i>Janizary Effendi</i> (or Lawyer), secretary
or clerk; the <i>Bashé chiaus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> his cap little and short
feathers. Then severall companyes of spahées.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The sub-basha
(or chief constable) of the Suburbs of Adrianople.
These were all in court coates, like Chaucer’s taberd,<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> armelesse,
yet little hanging sleeves as the picture of the Virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in C. Ricaut’s book, p. 43, fur’d within and without, either
cloth of silver, gold, satin, velvet, etc., all in chiaus caps but
the Effendi, whose cap was lawyer-like. At last came 30
mules handsomely trimm’d and furnisht, each loaden with
two little painted chests or boxes in which was gold and
silver, as is reported good store; next came in two rowes
(on either side the street) one 112 persons on foot, in
chiaus caps and well clad, bearing presents upon their
armes (some one, some 2, 3, or 4), distinctly wrapt up in
linnen, but every one was seen. They were peices for
vests of cloth of gold, silver, satin, velvet embroyder’d
works, pearl’d work, etc.; then a company of Janizaryes
and Cherbigees on foot; after them were led by foot
stately horses, and a strawish-colour’d bay was in the last
place, as delicately limm’d, as I declare it, I never saw the
like, with a curious starre on her forehead, about 15 hand
high, as we guest. These were designed for the G. S.
to dispose of as he pleased. After this came two little
<i>Náculs</i>, and then three or four artificial gardens, about 3
yards square, with pretty knols and walkes, full of floures
and trees, with their fruits all of tolerable waxe work, with
<i>Kioskes</i> (or summer-houses) in the middle, and severall
birds and beasts placed here and there amongst the plants
and trees; two had artificiall fountaines in them, which
were supplied with the same water by an engine of clockwork
contained within them. All these were carryed by
slings in the slaves’ hands, who were (as aforesaid) menaged
by galley-whistles; then followed, in two files on each side
of the way, one 120 sugar-workes, borne on frames by two
slaves a peice, sedan wise, made from 2½ foot to a yard and
half high, some more or less as the fancy required. They
were Ostridges, Peacocks, swans, Pelicans, etc., Lyons,
Beares, greyhoundes, dear, horses, Elephants, Rams,
Buffaloes, etc. (it is unlawfull to make the figures of men);
they were done brutishly and bunglingly. Then came a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
new set of Janizaryes and Cherbigees, and after them a
present of all things necessary for a Turkish lady in her
dressing-room; caryed open by men well clad, in two
files as before, viz., a paire of bootes (for here all women
do ordinarily wear such), a pair of <i>papoutches</i><a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> (sorts
of shoes), slippers, chioppines<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> (or pattens of wood): all
these wrought and cover’d with pearl of the bignesse of
ordinary cherry-stones the least, and intersperst with
Diamonds and rubyes, etc. It was a brave time for Jewellers;
any trash, if it made but a fair show at a distance,
was vendible at good rates.</p>

<p>Next came a sable embroyder’d vest with 9 large button
and loopes, Persian fashion, al set with pearl, rubeyes, and
a great diamond on every button; the 2d button and
loop, which serves for a clasp, had on either side a very
large table Diamond. Next followed severall round looking-glasses
with gold frames and cover (or door), and
stydded with pretious stones; then several mighty rich
girdles of stones set in gold and enamel; likewise several
bracelets for the hands, answerable to them. Here you
must understand that even women must have girdles,
bracelets, and topases, or else they are no gentle women,
as in England they are not without a black bag; the
bracelets are wrought of gold wire, sometimes gold plate,
from 1 to 4 or 5 inches wide, etc. There were two or three
gold chaines with large brooches of Diamonds (and the
like); at the end severall pair of earings, one amongst the
rest of 2 Emeralds, pear fashioned, very large, valued by
the Greeke that sold them (and shew’d me them before) at
5,000 zechines, or near upon 3,800 lb. sterling at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the dollar. In a pretty christall glasse, with a little golden
open frame, was caryed hanging a plain gold ring, with a
rose diamond of 11½ carats. Severall cabinets and dressing-boxes
adorned with pearl and jewels, severall Essence
boxes, and the like, set out in the same manner. At last
came a little crown all of beaten gold, studded with jewels
upon the fringe. Then came the Testerdor (or Lord
Treasurer) on horseback, who was <i>Vikéil</i>,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> or deputy, for
the <i>sposo</i>. He strew’d whole handfulls of aspers among the
people as he went, which was but very slowly; all the
presents being caryed in state, and as easily as foot could
fall; they were lay’d all upon fine handkerchiefs in silver
dishes. After the Testerdor rode his musick, 12 pipes, as
many drums, 6 trumpets, 6 kettle drums; four cymbalists, all
on horseback. After them come many, many servants leading
and riding their masters’ horses, who went before in the
shew on foot.</p>

<p>Take here, if you please, as exact account as I could get
of the manner of the Mariage and espousals. First, you must
understand all was treated by proxeyes (which they call
<i>Vickeel</i>), to the making of which two witnesses also were
appointed, all by the G. Sr., to wit, two <i>Cadeleschiers</i>, one of
Europe, the other of Asia. The proxeys were the <i>Kuzleraga</i>
for the <i>sposa</i>, the <i>Testerdore</i> for the sposo, and thus
they were made. The <i>Kuzleraga</i>,<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> with the two <i>Cadeleschiers</i>
as witnesses, went to the <i>Sultana’s</i> door, and knocking,
said: Sultana, are you content to make me your <i>Vikéel</i>
for marrying of you with Mustapha (the <i>Mosaïf</i> or
favourite)? She answers: Yes. He ask her this thre times
(on the other side the door, which must not be opened by
no meanes), likewise thre times the same. This is immediately
recorded by the two <i>Cadeleschiers</i>, and (as to the
Sultana) is irrevocable. Then the same witnesses goe with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the Testerdór to Mustapha or <i>Cool-oglan</i>, the <i>sposo</i>, and face
to face the Testerdor ask him the like words (<i>mutatis
mutandi</i>) thre times, and to each he answers: Yes. Then
away these go to the <i>Mufti</i> together; there they set down
in his court (of which afterwards), the <i>Mufti</i> in the midst,
with the <i>Kuzléraga</i> on the left hand (being the chief in
Turkey) and Testadore on the right, and the 2 Cadeleschiers
before them <i>alla Turchesa</i>, or at there feet <i>alla
Franca</i>. The Mufti asks wherefore they call’d him; they
answer: To perform a worke of Paradise, to wit, the
marriage of the <i>Sultana</i> and the <i>Mosaïf</i>. The Mufti
asks who are <i>Vikeels</i>; the Kúzleraga said: I am for
the <i>Sultana</i>; the <i>Testerdor</i>: I am for Mustapha; the
<i>Cadeleschiér</i>: We be witnesses to it. Then the <i>Mufti</i>
made the <i>Kuzléraga</i> and <i>Testerdore</i> to set one over against
the other, and asks the <i>Kuzléraga</i>: Are you content to take
<i>Mustapha</i> for your husband? This is done thre times, to
each of which <i>Kuzleraga</i> answer: Yes. Then he askes the
like (mutatis mutandis) of the Testerdor, to which he likewise
three several times answer: Yes. The Mufti then
demands the Testerdore what dowry he will promise to
make her; he answer: a yeare’s revenue of grand Cairo;
which is 600,000 zechines, at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the dollr.; it makes
of our sterling money 33,750 lb. (I must tell you, by the
by, that the greatest compliment to a fair woman in Turkey
is to tell her her eyes are worth a year’s revenue of
Grand Cairo.) Then the Mufti asks the Testerdor: Will
you give it? thre times; he as often answers: Yes. Then
he asks <i>Kuzleraga</i>: Will you accept it? thrice; he answers
as often: Yes. Then the Mufti sayth: <i>Bismillah</i> (in Dei
nomine). Then all standing up, he blesses the mariage;
and so entertayning them with Coffee and sherbert, etc.,
dismisses them. The G. Sr. immediately vested these with
cloth of gold and sables to the value of 1,000 dollrs.; the
other two (witnesses) with vests of 500 dollrs. I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
car’d if I had been <i>Mufti</i>; I am confident I could have
made as good a marriage. During the festivalls of the
circumcision, one day, all publick tradesmen were forc’d to
go in procession with every man his wagon locked, in which
he publickly labour’d at his trade—shoemakers, taylors,
weavers, etc.; so much as Bakers had an oven, smiths their
little forges, butchers flead their sheep, etc. Which you
may imagine such a piece of glorious madnesse as Europe
elsewhere cannot pattern. Every wagon was set out with
tokens of their art, and boughs and <i>bandiéras</i><a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> of silk or
painted paper at least.</p>

<p><i>June 19th.</i> The <i>Dote</i> (or the dowry) was carryed by
from the Seraglio, which was given by the G. Sr. to the
sposo, as in all your ordinary weddings, before the bride is
carryed her portion, which chiefly consists in vests and
clothing. There went many by towards the Seraglio to
come with the rest back again, as Janizaryes, Cherbigees,
the Vizier’s guards, Armorers, Cadeleschiers, and other
officers, Topgées (or gunners) in red caps. Their Head
men or bashas wore a furre cap, distinguished by the cock’s
feathers in the top; these being white and red intermixt,
the other all of one colour. The <i>Mosaïf</i> himself came by,
with the <i>Mufti</i> on his left hand.</p>

<p>We staid there about 1½ houre; then they all came back
in this order: First, the Topejées, Armourers, the Vizier’s
guards; then the G. Sr.’s, waiters in Caphtans (or court
vests): these serve him at table; then 4 or 5 Companyes of
Janizaryes and their Cherbigées, all in Caphtans, sattin
or velvet furred; then the <i>Aga</i> of the Janizaryes, with
his crew; next came many, many Pioners with shovels,
broams, etc.; then as many more Janizaryes with the
Janizary Aga, whome they repute a very severe man, who
never gratifyed any man that askt him anything, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
doeth all things of curtesy of his own head, or not at all;
any body is capable of that office, though he never was
Janizary before.</p>

<p>The Janizary Aga had now his <i>Santon</i><a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> (or Tom of
bedlame<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>) with him, with a strange kind of axe (or as they
call it, Balta) on his shoulder. Then severall companyes of
Janizaryes and Cherbigees; then about 100 chiaus’s with
their feathers of distinction, just before on the left side;
then 8 or 10 Executioners on foot. Then followed two
gardens in wax work, caryed by slaves as abovesaid;
then 40 little <i>Naculs</i> carryed by two files of Janizaryes.
Then followed 86 mules, some laden with two long square
sapets apiece, cover’d with <i>Caphtan</i> stuff; some laden
with 2 beds a piece with bedding, left all a little open
to be view’d by the standers by, and were all cover’d with
cloth of gold or sattin or velvet, richly embroyder’d, some
with silver, some with gold, some wrought with pearl. A
third part of the mules had two lesser square sapets (or
leather hampers) a peice, cover’d with black leather.
Then ten men bearing severall pieces of household stuff, as
furniture for beds, green satin foot cloths, plated with beaten
gold, several leather and velvet carpets, plated some as the
foot cloths. <i>Mum-sofras</i> (round leathers to set candles,
pots, etc., upon), plated likewise; 4 very large silver lanthornes,
the ribs gilt with gold. Then came by in like order,
as is before said, bootes, papoutches, slippers, chioppines,
set all with pearl and Diamonds; hand bracelets, girdles,
many pair of each, all gold and pretious stones; Looking
glasses, 4 close cabinets and 6 large open ones, such
as stand in Goldsmiths’ shops, all set out with jewels,
pearles, gold wire, etc. A little stool of pearl and jewels;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
a coronet of beaten gold. Some say all these were onely
the <i>Mosaïf’s</i> present (before mentioned) brought back again,
which is most likely, they now being part of the Sposa’s
accoutrements; though others would needs have them all
new.</p>

<p>After those came the Rice Effendi, with a Cadeleschier
on his right hand. Then the Testerdar, with another
Cadeleschier on his right hand. Then the Vizier, with the
Mufti on his left hand, of whome more hereafter. There
was also in the train, a little before the Rice Effendi,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> the
Vani effendi,<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> the greater preacher who prated down all
the coffee houses and Taverns, and, upon my life, it was
well done. More of him anon. Then, in the reer of them,
were the musick—pipes, trumpets, etc., on Camels; after
which followed many Janizaryes, and after them came
many women slaves, in 12 close coaches, with 2 black
Eunuchs before each coach, some of them inclining to
tawny, whereof three were very well featured youths, all
admirably well mounted, and exceedingly richly clad.
After the coach rode 12 blacks more, in one body, like the
rest—on horses, and habit, etc. All these were peculiar
to the Sposa, and were reckon’d as part of her goods; for
in many points the Civil Law of the Romans is here observed,
as above you may see, no marriage without a <i>Dote</i>.
Then followed about 40 servants on foot, leading as many
horses, laden with these slaves’ goods. Then followed the
Rabble.</p>

<p><i>Jun. 23.</i> The Sposa was carryed home, for, as I told you,
every wedding hath something of this formality. The
bridegroome sends presents with Naculs, etc., then the
Bride’s trumpery is brought in state, and she followes it,
allwayes hid under a square pavillion born over her, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Canopy at least. After the procession were carried two
gardens of fruits and floures in wax-work, with <i>Kiosks</i> in
the middle, caryed as before. Then 2 great Naculs caryed
by 160 slaves apiece, besides the guiders of the ropes and
stages as above. Then two little Naculs of silver, with each
of them a great candle at Top, which then were not lighted
(the fashion before the Armenians and Greekes is to carry
them lighted), but were to be lighted and renewed and kept
burning during the whole festival, something in imitation
of the old Hymenai; these were caryed by slaves, likewise
being very ponderous. Then came crab-faced Kuzleraga
and after him followed immediately (Dulcinia del Tobosa)
the fair Angelike <i>Agazé Sultana</i>, or, as others pronounce it,
<i>Hatajé Sultana</i> (the present Emperor’s eldest daughter), in
a coach plated all over with silver, and garnisht out with
gold, the wheeles and all other underwork (of wood and
Iron) richly guilt or varnisht; a covering on the Top (as the
fashion is) set with pearles and diamonds, six fair white
horses, all the harnesse plated with silver and gold, and
adorned with jewels. In their Tops each had a plume of
feathers hanged with jewels. A postilion rode the fore-horse
on the near side, and the coachman the hindermost
of the same side. The covering of the coach was, in part,
tuckt up to show the beauty of the work, which was so close
a lattice as you could perceive nothing but some opaque
body by help of the little light that crept in from the lattices
on the sides. There were several Eunuchs attended it,
whereof the first two strewed Aspers on both sides the
street amongst the people (whereof I have some to make
you a present of, if it please God we ever meet). One was
very well favour’d, a tawny, and the bones of his face in
very good symmetry, inclining to a tawny. I heard a
pleasant story of him, and once met him at a garden at
Adrianople, but I must let that pass now. Two more very
rich coaches, with 6 horses, plumed and bespatter’d with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
jewels, followed, in the latter of which (which was cover’d
with red broad cloth, and set out nobly) a very fine woman
opened a little hole at the fore end, and peep’d out at us.
Her face and head tire were very plainly seen. I dare not
say no lesse then that she was lovely. Her fingers and
part of her hand were peeping a good while before her
face, and her nails were stein’d (as the custome is here)
with <i>aleanna</i><a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> of a golden red (there were 4 blacks attended
each of these). Then followed two more ordinary coaches
with 6 horse, and two blacks apiece to attend them. Then
21 ordinary coaches more, many with 2 horses, most with
4, with one Eunuch to every of them. Then followed servants
with horses, and cloathes upon them, led by. About
half-an-hour after came the Sultana’s mother, in a very
rich coach of silver, and embellisht with gold. There were
4 Eunuchs to attend her, and a great company of <i>Baltajées</i>
axe men; as likewise 4 Eunuchs went a little before it.
Then followed 6 good coaches with 4 horse, and each had
a Baltaje riding in the Rose<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>; and one other by on foot.
Then came three more rich coaches with 6 horse, and two
<i>baltajées</i>, as the others. Lastly came one coach with 2
horses, and one <i>Baltajé</i>. There were many Blacks to accompany
these on horseback, beside the soe named, onely
they went straggling, and kept no order. In the rear followed
the rabble.</p>

<p>Now, you must understand, all these coaches are made
in the fashion exactly of waggons, onely they use cover’d
over head, and hang’d by slings so close as the body have
no room to swing, but jolts as hard as if it were fixt upon
the axletrees.</p>

<p>After the <i>Rebuil<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> evíl</i> moon was ended, there were every
day at <i>Kindi</i> (the 9th houre) sports at the Mosaïf’s house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
(which was in the city), and they lasted till midnight sometimes.
They began the 14th of June, when they first saw
the new moon, though it was a day old, it being by our
account two dayes old then; they ended the 28th day.
There was a very large square yard; at one end was a fair
apartment of two chambers, where the Mosaïf and his
friends continually were spectators; at the other end was
a large, high, single room, to which oftentimes resorted the
G. Sr., young prince, and many other favourites. After his
sposa (as is said, the 23d day) was brought home, there
was another square room in another corner with lattice-windows
(<i>gelosie</i>), through which she and the Q. mother
and others of the Ladyes saw all, being unseen themselves.
The door was kept very strickt, that no Janizaryes or
Turkes of fashion might enter, yet all strangers might go
in without any difficulty in the world. I was there many
times, of which some account by and by.</p>

<p>First, of the sports. We had every day the very same
dancing as before; the same shewes at interludes. There
were monkeyes, and dull Arab dancing, to entertain the
people; for on one side were pitched tents in which the
people stood, and the duller sports were before them.
We (Franks) had liberty to go up and down as near the
G. Sr. or Mosaïf as we pleased, and to stand and stare
upon them as long as we pleased. They, in like manner,
went to their devotions at <i>Kindi</i> (9th hour) and <i>Ackshám</i>
(the 12 hour), and yet immediately in their sports
they should applaud the same beastlinesse. 20 or 30
couple of wrestlers every day with their skins oyled all
over; they alwayes touch the ground first with their hands,
then put them to their head, then shake hands, or rather
take their hands flat wayes one between the other, then
kisse their own hands, and so begin; they say it is to call
Heaven and Earth to witnesse that they meet good friends,
and if any mischief happens it is beyond their intention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>There were tame bears played their tricks; once I saw
a little boy stark naked wrestle with one (taught on purpose),
which pleased mightily, and was shewn severall
times to the G. Sr. there. By the by, my Ld. caryed to
Adrianople a large English mastife, which had fought in
private with the biggest bear, and worsted her in single
combat; he made a present of him, which the G. Sr. took
mightily kindly. They call our mastifes <i>Samsons</i>, and the
G. Sr. nourishes severall, and hath here hard by our house a
sommering-house for them; but this dog was half as high
again as any of those which he had (which I have seen
severall times), and that made him more acceptable.
There were the same tumbling, stilts, and the <i>Bostanjé</i> with
his stone Bottels, and the rest; but the best entertainment
was rope-dancing, whereof there was but little in the other
place; but here every day as good, and in some things
better than all that ever I beheld in my life.</p>

<p>I shall now conclude with something that I am sure is
not ordinary (if ever it was done) in England. From the
top of Sultan Selim’s Mineret or steeple (which, as I
measured it, is about 84 yards high, but the place I now
shall speake of was 70 yards and 1 foot high) was stretcht
a rope right over the houses down into this yard; there
were two men came sliding down with pulleyes, one tyed
to the hair of one of them, the other fasten’d the pulley to
his ancle, and holding by it with his hands, sometimes slid
soe part of the way, sometimes hanging at his length with
his head down. The first time they tryed, the rope yeilded
so much as if some men had not stood on purpose to catch
them they had been beaten to peices upon the tops of the
houses and trees that stood about that end of the Mosaïf’s
yard, which was under the Rope; they then lengthened
the rope and stretcht it very tight farther into the yard.
This Rope was 460 yards long at first; they lengthen’d it
to 480. Every day somebody or other slided down thus, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
upon their breasts. One day a lusty fellow would needs
slide down with a boy at his back, with a drum and a stick
and switch to beat it; just as they came half way the rope
broke, and down they fell upon a poor Armenian who was
standing in the garden amongst others to view the sight.
All thre were prety hurt and bruised, but it pleased God
all thre recover’d. The G. Sr. paid for their cure, and
offered the Armenian a pension of 20 aspers per diem as
long as he lived; but he, thanking him, sent him word that
he desired nothing else but that he might have 12 purses
of money paid him which a great Basha had owed him a
long time; but if he dyed he bequeathed it freely to the
G. Sr. The G. Sr. gave orders that it should be done
forthwith. He had only his shoulder put out of joynt and
his body bruised; but I have seen him since well recovered.
The other two were rewarded too; the man with a pension
of 40 aspers per diem, the boy was taken into the Seraglio.
Upon the 27 day (which was the last day that they could
use this rope) two men walkt up this rope to the minaret;
one came foot by foot back again down into the yard, and
the other stay’d at the top of the <i>mineret</i>.</p>

<p>Now if any one in England had a mind to break his neck
dexterously and <i>secundum artem</i>, I have told you how (if he
have not very good luck) he may do it effectually. Every
night there were fireworkes here of the same nature with
the forementioned. There were here two Elephants and
Castles encounter’d, with all sorts of wild fire, very
curiously; but there were no great rockets or fire that
would mount, for fear of firing the City. Here were several
sorts likewise of your lamp work. Still we found the
greatest civility imaginable, and were severall times
treated with sherbert of lemmons (once with coffee and
sweet meats in a low room; the Aga who carryed us in
telling us that it would be a shame for us to come to the
wedding of the G. Sr.’s daughter, and neither eat nor drink).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
We were commonly carryed into the Ring, and seated by
ourselves, and many times had a Cherbigée or a Janizary to
keep the crowd from coming near us. I suppose it was
more out of ostentation than any great love to us; and
dayly came <i>Sackáls</i> or budget men with a budget of
sherbert, and cups into which he fil’d it out, and gave to us
constantly, amongst the rest of the people of any fashion.</p>

<p>I (as is said) was severall times as near the G. Sr. as I
pleased, and saw the manner of his state. He commonly
sat upon a rich wrought or embroyder’d silk quilt, and
sometimes the Prince was here with him (but we could not
tell what here they sat on, they being so high above us); and
about him were 8 or 10 handsome young men continually
fanning him by couples. He never here appear’d in any rich
or gaudy apparell, seldome smil’d; few courtiers near him
in publick, and those but a very little, little time. Once
the Vizier sat and talk’t with him in view about a quarter
of an houre. The Mosaïf had continually company with
him—the Testerdare, Kaimacham, sometimes the Vizier.
He is a black man, sharp, descreet (or streight) nose, yet
sadled a little between his eyes, some what beetle browed,
broad flat faced, Russe-fashioned, but onely his hair is
black, whereas their’s is red, white, or fair colour’d; his eyes
pinking and smaller then proportion, and they are something
hollow.</p>

<p>About <i>Kindi</i> come up severall of the G. Sr.’s Fakoners,
with their Spaniells and severall most excellent hawkes;
as certainly the whole world have not better. They
seldome keep a Hawke above one season, but turne her
out loose, and every year have new birds taken in plenty.
They fist their hawk on the right fist; they serve their
hawke with the lower joynt of the legge (instead of the
head, after our manner), and therefore not a Phesant is to
be bought in the mercate (unlesse it was caught some other
way) with two legges. For you must understand in Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
side are many men keep hawks to get a livelyhood; and
they furnish our Mercates. There are such every where,
but onely they are not suffer’d near his court least they
should spoyl his game.</p>

<p>One of our Merchants and I were walking out one night
by the river side, and the Vizier’s Aga came by with 3
casts of Hawks and spaniels, and at least 16 or 20 men. I
had chanc’t to kill a snipe crosse the river, and I had an
old dog of my Ld. Harvey’s, which I sent for it. He was
the most pleased with the sight that could be; we walkt on,
but as we return’d we found him setting in the shade under
a tree. We would have avoyded him, but he sent one of his
men to call us; we obey’d. He had now sent home his
dogs and hawkes, and most of his company; and he had
gotten from a little town hard by a great bottle of wine of
at least 5 or 6 quarts. He made us set downe, and there we
drank out every drop of his wine; onely we three setting
down. His servants, which there were not above 5, stood
round us. He made two of them pipe to us all the time,
which I swear was so sweet, as I never heard the like in
Turkey. Their pipes were the true Tibiae; being made of
the shank bone of a Bustard (as we guest at his description
of it). He courted me extreamely for my dog; but I told
him he was old and now worth nothing, and besides, it was
the remembrance of an excellent friend; with which he
was hardly satisfied. After he had gotten his <i>Keéf, or
Keph</i> (his heart and head merry), we parted with all the
civility in the world. There I learn’d a great deal of
Falconry; which made me here bring the story in.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Plague at Adrianople.</span></h4>

<p>About the beginning of July happen’d a very grievous
plague at Adrianople. It was very rife round about us,
and so drove us out of town to a little village about a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and ½ of to the W., called <i>Caragatch</i> (or black tree). It is
in vain to tell you the many, many perills I was in, and it
would be too troublesome for you to heare them, and for
me to tell them. I shall onely say that, by constantcye,
the Plague and all discourses about it grew so familiar to
me as I was no more moved at them then at the newes of
agues, or the new disease in autumne. My Ld. had a
house here for himself, but all we were lodged, one here,
another there, as we could procure single rooms. In the
Towne are most Greekes, and the parson was infinitely
civil to me, and got me a little room to myself, hard by
my Ld.’s house; but within one month the plague set into
this town likewise, and first seized my Land lady’s onely
daughter, who every day I used to prattle withall. Our
Tents were set up, and I removed thither, rather then
come near any body to fright them; but in 5 or 6 dayes
it come every where so fiercely, that it drove my Ld. and
all the rest downe into the tents to me, and I, lying in my
Ld.’s tent before, was now disappointed and forct (with two
more companions) to go to town again, where I and they
lived (till we were coming home) in the parson’s stable—and,
faith, we past our time like princes, for we were within two
bowes shot of the tents, and there we went to dinner and
supper, and retired when we pleased. With carpets and
mats we had made as good a sleeping hole as could be
of it. There dyed at one time about 900 per diem in
Adrianople, and above half this town dyed or fled. At
last my two companions returned for <i>Stambol</i>, and then my
Ld. would not let me stay there alone, so I had a little tent
provided for myself and my man. Within one week the
plague got into our tents amongst the servants. My Ld.
and Sir Thomas fled to the Town again, the Plague being
somewhat ceased at that end about their house. We endur’d
at the tents, and I assure you there is no preservative
like a merrie heart and a drame of the bottle. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
lost our Baker, and 3 or 4 more of our servants, but the
rest escaped—blessed be God. I was forc’t to remove my
Tent twice, for it was gotten in the next tent to me,
within 20 yards, amongst one of our chiause’s servants.
There was not a man of us but was amongst plaguy
people dayly. Count Bocareschi (as is said) came and
dined with my Ld., and drank with us, with a plague sore
upon him, of which he dyed the next morning.</p>

<p>This village has a little church dedicated to two saints,<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
ὃ ἅγιος Θεόδωρος ὃ τηρῶν and ὃ ἅγιος Θεόδωρος στρατηλάτης.
They are famous for curing sore eyes, and, therefore,
there are infinite little silver plates sloped and hollowed
like eyes, and hang’d up as the antient ἀναθήματα.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>The River Arda and Meritch (Maritza<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>) joyne a little
mile of, and then come running under this town; and
here it is very sandy, and seldome clear in summer, for
all the ground about it is very sandy, which, being dry in
summer, upon every wind is carryed into the river, which
makes it very shallow and broad. It is here fordable all
the summer, but in winter, by floods from the hills, it
overflowes into many outlets, which are dry in summer, as
you may perceive the pricked<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> river next to <i>Dimirdesh</i>.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
The fish are few and unwholesome. I saw a carp taken
just 33 inches and 7/10 long. I saw one at Stambol once
somewhat above 36 inches, and my Ld. Harvey assured me
he had one at his audience in Salonica about 40 inches
long.</p>

<p>There were 50 Greek familyes in town, and about 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Turkish <i>cheflicks</i>,<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> or summer houses. The best sort of
people fled to other places, as the Turkes likewise themselves
did from Adrianople to their houses here, for that
same is a story that they are not afraid of the plague,
because their fortunes are wrote in their forehead; for all
fled, but such as were poor, or had offices about Court, and
could not get away. There dyed that year about 100
persons out of the Vizier’s own house; and really, those
that are forc’t to stay by it value it no more then we do an
ague. But this is the same amongst Jewes, Greeks, Armenians,
and every body else.</p>

<p>Mr. North<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> staid in Adrianople all the time, and come to
us every day; I went to him severall times, and as I live I
valued no more to meet a dead corps then a dead calf.
Yet I have met above 20 in a morning, going from our
tents to Mr. North’s house; and there is more danger in
passing by the clothes of the living then in touching the
body of the dead. All slaves and poor people, so soon as
they are dead, are wrapt in some pittiful covering (perhaps
nothing but an old mat), and so laid upon a <i>Hamál’s</i> or
porter’s back, and caryed away to his grave, without any
more adoe. Infinites of Turkes came out of the Town and
lived in Tents, as well as we; yet many Turkes came or
sent out their women to their countrey houses there. I
chanc’t to see a couple of very lovely women severall times,
which came and lived in a fine house just by me, and being
under the government of onely one poor silly old man,
they would get out into a great garden there hard by, and
romp and play the rogue like little sprites; but more of
that between ourselves.</p>

<p>This whole town live by selling of wine, and every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
come hundreds of people from Adrianople to be drunk; so
that it was impossible but that the Plague should be
brought thither. The Janizary Aga gets at least 10,000
dollars a year out of them for selling their wine; and yet
he came there many times in show of severity, but notice
was alwayes given at least an hour before he came, so that
he alwayes found the coast clear. By the by, I must tell
you that the Turkes love wine, and drink as much as other
people; I am assur’d not one person in 5 (throughout all
this part that I have travayled) refuseth it; at Court (excepting
the G. Sr. himself, the Mosaïf, and Kaimacham)
not a man but will take his <i>Keiph</i> profoundly. I have seen
the Vizier himself, <i>Mamúr</i> that is, crop sick<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> severall times.
All the Greekes and Armenians (not daring to be merry
in Adrianople in companyes) come here to feast, and I have
been severall times by when 200 or 300 persons have all
been setting together feasting and drinking like fishes; and
the Turkes observe the same freedome, or rather take much
more.</p>

<p>My Landlord (the Parson) was the greatest vintner in
the town, and to secure his wine he put the greatest part of
it into a place in the Church; and in the yard by us the
chief Turkes of the City would come and be merry
publickly; the common Turkes never drink but to stark
drunkennesse. The Parson had a kinswoman that lived
but on the other side of our hedge; she was the onely child
of her father, who would come and be merry with us, and
we went thither to him often. This man was very rich and
had promised his daughter and all that he had to a young
silly fellow in town. She was extraordinary handsome and
ingenious, and cared not for her lover. I know not how it
came to passe, though they lived alone and had no neighbours,
but yet she got the Plague, and dyed. I could tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
you a most passionate story of her, but let this suffice.
There were about 500 Greekes came to her buryall, notwithstanding
the Plague, and the Metropolite of Adrianople
came to burye her; and the chief of the Town, which were
fled, came back to the funerall. The young fellow was in
a manner distracted, and came constantly every morning
for many dayes, and mourned over her grave.</p>

<p>The manner of the Christians buriall here is much the
same; all have the <i>Praeficae</i>,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> who sing (or rather howl and
snarlle out), which they begin at home and continue to
the grave. The weather was excessive hot, and the air
stagnated in a manner, we being placed in a pan or flat;
so that it was plague enough merely to stay there. Whilst
we were in Adrianople the rats and mice, and fleas, and
rumbling of carts al night long, and brawling of curs (great
numbers being nourisht in every street), and the stink of
the Jewes, did give us no small purgatory; but coming
here, where we thought to have had braver accommodations,
we found it worse. The terrible heat of the sun
reflected from a dry barren sandy soil, and the fulsome
foggy aire, broyled us and choked us.</p>

<p>We stayed there about 3 months, and returning to
Stambol we found the plague as hot there; and we lost one
of the servants that waited in my Ld.’s chamber (within a
fourtnight after we came home) of it, and since we have
found that another had it, but conceal’d it. For my part I
am not so Calvinized as to say our Fate or Fortune is wrote
in oure forheads; but this I will say, I think verily it was
God alone that hath preserved me from so many deaths.
Some that knowe me, I believe, may wonder what the
Devil bewitch me to stay in this Hell of a place; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
good earnest I have wondered at myself, but that Fate (I
think indeed) was written in my heart, and now begins to
be obliterated; but so moch for that. Now I will give you
a little account of the country round about, as farre as I
have been.</p>

<p>The River Vardar and Meritch (Maritza), as is said, before
they came to this town, meet; and a little above, upon the side
of a hill betwixt them, is a pretty little countrey town most
Greekes called <i>Marás</i>. A little further under the hill, next
towards <i>Meritch</i>,<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> is a little pit of a blewish sort of clay; here
a company of old gossips at the 15th of Aug., which is the
Assumption of the B. V., bring water from the river and mix
it and the clay together into a perfect pudding or stodge;
and on that daye infinites of people, Turkes, Jewes, and
Christians, resort thither and goe in, and tumble in the
mire, which they believe will cure any sort of infirmity;
and without doubt it often happens so.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> These old Hags
tell how in the night before the water springs out of the
ground, and how it lasts till the Octave (that is, the 22nd
day), and then dryes up; both which I proved to be a
notorious lye. Yet the people are so zealously bent to
believe the story, as I had liked to have <i>been imbroglid</i> for
disputing of it. The earth is a kind of fuller’s earth, or
very obstersive, and may doe good in many cutaneous
diseases, without the help of the Παναγία,<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> as they call
her.</p>

<p>On the other side that river, under a great ridge of hills
or mountaines, is another pretty Greek village cal’d in
Turkish Cadun-cui (Khanoum-cui), or Ladyes town; there
is excellent wine there. Over the mountain is a great
Turkish Town, famous for a Seraglio of the G. Sr., whither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
he retired in the Plague, leaving the Vizier to act all. It
is call’d <i>Ack-bonar</i><a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> (white fountain), and seemes at a distance
a brave place.</p>

<p>Acrosse the river from our town (Caragátch<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>), upon the
top of a high hill, stands a little (but very curious) Seraglio,
or rather Kiosk or sommer house, whither the G. Sr. retires
for a fine girle sometimes; and it is contrived very convenient
for the purpose. I have been in it; it is the best
prospect about all Adrianople; they call it <i>Khiderleh</i>,
which is the same with St. George, it having been formerly
a Greek church of that name. You must know St. George
is a great saint even amongst the Turkes, and their galleyes
commonly set out that day to the White Seas. I have been
many times reflecting on the name which they give him,
<i>Khiderleh</i> (and very commonly <i>Khidreleh</i>), the <i>Khi</i> being
pronounced strong in the throat like an aspirate, and I
have fancy’d it to be taken (as is perhaps the whole story)
from ὓδρα; and both that tale of Hercules and the Hydra,
and Apollon and the Python, from Eve and the serpent. I
may venture to give my conjecture now Dr. Haylin<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> is
dead, and I shall be obstinate in it too.</p>

<p>At the bottome of that hill, next Adrianople, is a large
suburb cal’d <i>Ildrém</i>,<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> or thunder. Round about <i>Khiderléh</i>,
and all the waye upon the mountaines betwixt <i>Ack-bónor</i>
and Khanoum-cui, are planted vineyards most plentifully;
the Turkes by their law may eat what grapes they please
(it being the greatest part of their food from August to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Christmasse), and now (as is said) they freely taste the
blood likewise.</p>

<p>On the North-east of Adrianople stands the Seraglio,
which is very large, and on one side of it runs the river
Tunza,<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> on the other side is a plain where we saw all the
sights. There is a very stately bridge, or rather pile of
stone, built over the Tunza from Adrianople to <i>Ildrem</i>; it is
at least 970 of my paces long, and was built by Michael
Waivod of Moldavia, as is cal’d Michael’s<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Kupru, or
Michael’s bridge. Tunza under it meets with a branch of
Arda-Meritch; over Tunza by the Seraglio on the Town
side is a very strong stone bridge; on the other side, about
a mile and a half from it, is another bridge of wood. Upon
that river on the west side, a little farther, <i>Backstrevacui</i>,
where they make very good tiles and brick; next stands
<i>Carajauis</i>, on the other side about 2 miles distant; and the
mountaines on the east side of it have many quarreys of
soft spongy stone, yet they use it in many buildings. It
stands over against <i>Ack-bonar</i>. About 2 or 3 mile farther is
<i>Corojecui</i>, a little village, and about a mile farther is a very
fine lake call’d by the Turkes Gióle-babba, or father Lake
(Giole being a lake); it stands with Tunza on the West,
high hills on the E., and <i>Corojécui</i> to the S. It is well
stock’t with fish (and fowl in the winter time); we saw
there in August multitudes of Pelicans, swans, and some
Ducks. At the East end of it, at the foot of the hills,
stands a summer-house of the G. Sr.’s, furnisht allwayes
ready. There are many excellent fountaines of very good
water; there are some few houses about it inhabited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Turkes; we found them civil, and had liberty to go in and
see what we desired. It is seated very pleasantly, being
overshadowed by many Chinár (or Plane) trees. The Lake
is round about environed with a great quantitye of sedge,
which yearly yeild a plentifull crop.</p>

<p>The river Tunza comes from a place cal’d now <i>Yianobole</i>,<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
but I never was higher upon it then this place; all the
way hither it runs very crooked and winding, and the hills
on both sides lye in like manner winding in and out, and
make a crook’d but large meadow or plain, in which the
G. Sr. or Vizier, drawing out their forces for the warres,
first pitch their tents. We saw all along the <i>vestiges</i> of
them, and many, many ovens and kitchings framed in the
earth, to make ready their bread (the true staff of a Janizaryes
life), and <i>pelów</i>,<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> or Boiled rice.</p>

<p>From Caragatch to Adrianople we passe thre long
bridges, the first of wood, serviceable onely in winter,
the water being little or nothing in sommer; yet this
bridge is the longest, and the river under it is nothing but
sand. The second bridge is likewise wood, over a branch
of the river that runs all sommer; for after Arda and
Mellitch (Maritza) meet they go in one stream to the city,
where meeting with Tonza (Tondja), they again divide
into two streames, making severall very pleasant little
Islands. About 2 or 3 mile of the City, to the South, is
seated a large town call’d <i>Bosnacui</i>,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> where the French
Ambassadore was seated when he was at audience; and
he tells me that upon that Island are about 9 or 10 such
villages more. The rivers running on either side about 10
or 12 mile unite into one again, and the broad sandy brook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to the W. enters into the same channell likewise; of these
three the first is call’d (likewise on this south side the City)
<i>Tonza</i>, the middle one <i>Merrich</i>, the sandy one <i>Ardar</i>; as if
the 3 streames after that had met at Adrianople, sever’d
themselves intirely again. By this you may see the error of
our common maps placing Adrianople upon the <i>Hebrus</i>,
which cannot be properly said to be till all these three meet
again beneath <i>Bosnacui</i>; at least the currents are falsely
there by them laid down. <i>Mellitch</i> comes from Pilippopoli,<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
Arda comes from Sta. Sophia<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>; upon which, next to
<i>Caragátch</i>, stands <i>Choróocui</i>, or rotten town. About it are
many long (but narrow) lakes, which may give the name
in Turkish; and there growes infinity of <i>Tribulus aquaticus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
which the vulgar Greek calls ἀγριοκάστανο, or wild chestnut,
and from thence they call the name of the town in Greek
Καστανοχωριὸ. Southerly from the river Arda is another
village, cal’d in Turkish <i>Ishék-cui</i>,<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> or Asses town, in Greek
Γαιδαροχωριὸ, which signifyes the very same; it was cal’d
formerly ἀηδονοχωριὸ, that is Nightingale town, but (as the
Greeks now tell the story) a great lord of this countrey
whom they call Ἰουλιανούφερα, whom they make a Turke,
sent for the Bishop of this town, who chanc’d to anger
him highly about a <i>Cheflick</i>, or summer house, which he
desired of the Bishop there; and therefore he swore that
whosover cal’d it hereafter otherwise then γαίδάρο-χωριὸ
should be hang’d.</p>

<p>As much farther, just at the foot of mount Rhodope, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
very near Arda, is <i>Orta-cui</i>,<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> in Greek βουλγαροχωριὸ,
whether the Germane resident went to avoyd the Plague.
I was two or three dayes entertain’d there like a prince;
and observed this and what followes: and, believe me, I
will take it upon my credit to maintain this to be a pretty
exact map of what is here set down. <i>Orta-cui</i> is a very
populous town, built thre quarters round a very steep hill,
like an Amphitheater reinverst or imbost. There are
about 1,500 familyes in it, all Greekes. There crept in
some few Turkes, but all the town setting against them,
and playing them scurvy tricks, made them soon weary,
and they have not of late had any, though it is a very
paradise to live in. All the hills are cover’d with vineyards,
which make a pleasant red wine, which we might buy anywhere
for 5 aspers per <i>Ook</i>,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> that is, about 3 pints. The valleyes
grow either very good corne or pasture. On the south
side the village, about ½ an hour, is amongst the hills a
most pleasant clear fountain of purging waters, but they
work without the least offence. On the North side, towards
the east, is a great plain, very fruitfull in all manner
of corne and flaxe. The town stands within ½ houre
from the Arda, which runs amongst the mountaines most
clear, and very deep. Just against this town it hath a mill
set on it, on the side of which, towards the hills, it is very
deep, and full of great rocky stones, those hills being
nothing else. On the other side it is very shallow, with a
small stream, and little pebbles at bottom, but no sand till
below <i>Ishek-cui</i>, where the land round about is sandy;
which confirmes me in my opinion that the river by Caragatch
and Adrianople is so foul and sandy from the sand
driven from shore by the wind; though beneath Adrianople,
towards <i>Bosnacui</i>, it is foul by reason all the dunghills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
(the Turkes using little manure or compasse<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>), and carryon,
and filth, and dead men (many whereof we saw dayly
thrown in, being either executed, or perhaps dead of the
Plague) which are continually thrown in. Here likewise
are taken as good and sweet fish as may be—Carps,
Roach, Dace, Pikes, and (above all) a pale-flesh’t trout,
which are good, from the stony bottom; whereas, about
Adrianople, from the sand or otherwise, all fish taste
fleshy and beastly.</p>

<p>A little above this mill, next the town, amongst the hills,
hath been a large old castle; part of the walls are yet
standing. The high mountaines, quite above, are now
cal’d Θεοβουνὸ, or God’s hill. I guesse not but these
ridges of mountaines are the true <i>Rhodope</i>,<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> for the great
road from Adrianople to <i>Salonica</i> lyes over there, and all
travaylers assure me that on the other side are no other
hills at all till they come to Hemus, which they still call
ἁμομὸντε.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> There is but little earth and few trees upon
these mountaines that I ever saw. The stone, where it
is naked, lyes many times Horizontal, but oftener declining.
Arda comes running from the S.W. amongst
these hills, having his head about 4 dayes journey (as
they informe me) from <i>Ortacui</i>, at a place called <i>Darovasi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
not farre from Sta. Sophia. Here are many,
many houses built of wood entirely, the walls being
made of whole trees hewn down and clench’t<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
ends. There are a few such at <i>Caragatch</i>. I am informed
that in Poland almost all mean people’s houses
are such.</p>

<p>All the people of this town seem to live well. We
chanc’t to be there after harvest, when they were treading
out their corn. That fashion, and the threshing
floores (as we translate it), or publick places to which they
bring their whole crop to tread the corne out, are still here
every where in use, no other way being known to Turke
or Greek but that, and no barnes being to be found, but
so soon as ever they have cut down their corn, they tread
it out immediately, which is likewise done with oxen yoked
to a great thick plank (which these people and the Islanders
call ροκάνη<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>) about a yard and a half long and a yard broad.
The bottome is all filled with sharp flints stuck into it.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
Upon the top stands a person, who also guides the oxen
round, and pricks them forward with a goad. In a great
floor you shall have 2 or three of these, and as many yoke
of oxen at a time. After they have trodden, or rather
bruised, one flooring out, they lay another; thus all the
strawe is broken to pieces like chaf, and thence it is call’d
chopt straw. What from the slovenlinesse of their dressing
their corne, and the badnesse of their mill stones
(they being onely some pieces of very hard stone joyned
together with a strong mortar, and collar’d in a hoop of
Iron), there is no bread or meal in this part of Turkey but
what is very gritty. Some of the Turkes do muzzle their
oxen, but not all. In sharing their corn they have a kind
of wooden glove on the 4 fingers of the left hand, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in Greek they call παλαμαριὰ,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> to guard their hand from
thistles and the like.</p>

<p>You cannot imagine the strange superstition that is
generally amongst the people of this countrey; Turkes,
Jewes, Greekes, Armenians, all have their amulets and
Telismes (talismans) and φυλακτὴρια about themselves,
but especially about their children, their horses, their
houses. Nightingales are very commonly kept in cages
and let out to sing by so much per diem, but you shall not
see one but shall have a deal of this trumpery about the
cage. The Turkes have commonly their Telismes engraved
on silver or gold; I have seen 10,000 lye in goldsmiths’
boxes to be sold upon all occasions; there are peculiar
arts of making of these, but I count them all meer old
wives’ conceits. There was a Scotchman here who much
delighted and practised in such mysteries, and gave me the
best account he could, but I will assure you they are more
absurd and nonsensicall then figure flinging<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>; and since he
was gone I chanc’t to dine one day with the French Ambassador,<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
when he had on purpose sent for the most noted
Turk in all these parts for such things. It will be tedious
for to recount you all that past, but we manifestly proved
him an impudent imposter. He got his <i>Keiph</i> there
sufficiently, and that was (I believe) his chief design.
Your Greekes count nothing more sacred then the
ἀντίδωρον,<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> the bread (not the sacrament), which is blest
and distributed amongst the people upon Holy Thursday;
this they call ίψωμα, perhaps from our Saviour’s ascention.
At <i>Ortacui</i> you would scarce see a little child but it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
some of this either in a little silver box about their necks,
or stitched up in a bit of silk, or tyed in a little rag; I
have observed the like in many other places; many carry
wolves’ teeth, or the bones of their toes, etc., set in silver
or gold; bones or parts of frogs, mice, lizards, Hippocampus,<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
etc.</p>

<p>As we went home from Ortacui we were driven into a
town by a storme, and laid there the most part of the night.
Our Janizary chanc’t at our going into the house to catch
a bat; he rejoyced exceedingly, and borrowing a zechine of
me (the ceremony must be done with gold or not worth a
farthing), he cut the throat of it therewith, pronouncing the
name of God and some other conceits; he saved every drop
of the blood in cotton, and kept it as a most divine thing.
By this, he said, he could make friends with any one;
love in a woman; in fine, preserve himself and us from
all evil.</p>

<p>We set out from that little town, and were overtaken in a
most dreadful tempest of Thunder and lightning; just getting
up a steep bank a flash of lightning discharged a sheet
of fire, which fell on the ground and rested there a good
while, within lesse then two yards of me and Dr. Pickering
(we two being foremost), and huft<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> my hat and vest like a
mighty gust of wind; our horses trembled and stood as half
dead, but presently we got forward. All the world will not
persuade that fellow but that the blood of his Bat preserved
us. I have now been too, too impertinent, but yet could
adde much more to this purpose about your Greekes or
βροκόλακα<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> (the walking of dead men), and their solemne
prayers and exorcismes of their church in that point. Also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
concerning the Armenians’ <i>caracóngilas</i><a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> (or hobgobling, or
kind of Robbin good fellow), which is universally believed
by them, and on the 13th and 14th of Feb. have a solemnity
on purpose about it. Likewise about witches (which
certainly, if there be any in the world, they are here) I
can tell you storyes which will much amaze you; yet I
must confesse I am very slow of belief in that point. I have
likewise a strange Greek MS. presented me concerning
such whimsyes; but enough of this matter. Before the
Plague I walk’t about all the town; the old city (as is said)
is not above a 3rd part of the whole, and the walls are
pittyfull thin brick work.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * * * *</div>

<p><i>July 27th.</i> My Lord had audience with the G. Sr., notwithstanding
the height of the Plague. He came from
Ackbonar to the Seraglio on purpose, for my Ld. was very
pressing for it, and in earnest. We had stay’d a longer
time then ordinary for it. It was performed as followeth:
The time being appointed two days before, that morning,
an hour before day, came two Chiauses to Caragatch to
call us. We went suddainly to the foot of the 2d wooden
bridge before mentioned, and there stay’d in tents till the
rest of the chiauses came to conduct us, about 50 in all
(they are paid by us a zechine apiece, and therefore we
may have as many as we please, if we count their number
a glory). Thus we passe to the Town side, where my
Ld. mounted his best horse, and rode quite through the
City upon him; and we came to the seraglio gate about ½
an houre past 5 in the morning. After a little stay there,
the <i>chiaus basha</i>, and <i>capige basha</i>, and <i>Peskeshjé<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> basha</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
came to my Ld. to conduct him in. We past from the
gate directly to the divan upon a stone caseway, through
a square court, which I guesse every way is about 160 of
my paces. The <i>Peskeshjé basha</i> is the same, in a manner,
as our maister of the ceremonyes. <i>Peskesh</i> signifyes a
present, as if <i>peskeshjé</i> were one of the Maisters of the presents,
and <i>Peskeshjé basha</i> is the head or chief of them all.
This man walkt with a great silver staff in his hand (as
bigge as the Cambridge beadle) before my Ld. to shew him
where to make his reverences: for you must understand all
the sides of the court were lined with Janizaryes and other
souldjers; therefore, as my Ld. past, he bowed to the
Janizary Aga, <i>Bash</i>. <i>Chiaus</i>, <i>Chia Beghi</i>, and other great
officers of the souldjery there. We came at last to the
large Divan, which is just in the same fashion as that at
Stambol (which I have seen), onely the side at Stambol
hath no seates as this hath. The seates (or bench from
which the inferior viziers are named of the bench) round
the three sides are cover’d with embroyder’d silk, as likewise
the whole floor of the same. Under it, upon the
benches, is one continued quilt, or kind of cushion, quite
round. In the middle of the side was a rich foot cloth,
which reached from the back of the bench (or wall) down
into the floor. Here sat the <i>Nesharjé basha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> who (is a
principal secretary, and) writes the Grand Sr.’s Firme<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> (or
Fiat) to all his commands. There enters a little door on
one side, where is such another foot cloth, onely every
way larger. There sat the <i>Vizier Azém</i>. Over his head
was a <i>Gelosia</i>, or lattice (as at Stambol), where the G. Sr.
is often (as he was then) present, but incognito; and, as
we guest, the Sultana was there once, yet some say it was
impossible. On the same side sat 2 Cadeleschiers on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
another foot cloth. The other side is open from the
bench up to the top of the roof. Here sat the Testerdare
upon such another foot cloth. In the room behind him
sat severall men of the law, who, upon occasion, could
speak or receive any writing, or other matter, into the
Divan, that side, as is said, being open, onely two wooden
pillars supporting the roof. The Divan might be about
8 or 9 (at most) yards square. There is a stone gallery
open into the court, out of which we enter’d, then into the
Divan, which is open into the Gallery and court. My Ld.,
making his reverence to the Vizier and the rest, was placed
in the corner upon the bench, without a foot cloth, beneath
the Nesharjé, which was the lowest place, to wit, the right
hand. <i>Mauro Cordato</i><a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> (the Vizier’s Dragoman) and my
Ld.’s two Dragomen in chief stood next him. Then all we
stood with our backs to the court; we might turne side
wise to look out, but one or two turning their backs to the
Vizier were reprehended as guilty of too much rudeness.
All of us being thus disposed of, immediately were brought
in 320 purses of money, and lay’d in 32 heapes upon the
floor, before the Vizier, a purse being 500 dollars. There
were two little bags that were layd by themselves. You
must know that the Janizaryes and souldjers about the
court are pay’d once a month in this manner, publickly,
before the Vizier and the Divan. But now the pay day
was put of till my Lord’s audience, it being a thing usually
done at all Embassadores audiences, merely for to show
the grandeur and glory of their Empire, though sometimes
it happens otherwise. The Testadore therefore, after the
money was lay’d down, gave up his accounts to the Vizier.
He, kissing them, sent them to the G. Sr. by the <i>Peskeshjé
basha</i>, and by him they were presently return’d again to
the Vizier, who received them with a kisse. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
severall chambers of Janizaryes (which stood round the
court) were call’d in order, the word being given by the
<i>Peskeshjé basha</i> very loud. The whole chamber comes
running together upon the case-way to the door, where
they received their proportionate bagges to be divided by
themselves or officers. And, after the first chamber was
paid of, they past away, and the next was call’d; and so
till all was paid out. Then the Cherbigees (the colonells)
and other head officers came into the Divan, and, kneeling
down on the Vizier’s left hand, kist the left corner of his
vest, and put it to their head, returning (as all the rest,
that make reverence by saluting his vest, doe) three or
four steps backwards and sideways, get out of his presence,
he all the time sitting like a statue, neither bowing nor
taking the least notice imaginable. The Testerdare (who
many times had occasion to whisper with him) went
alwayes to him without any ceremony at all. All this
being over, basons, and ewers, and towells were brought
in, and the Vizier, Testerdare, Neshanjé basha, and my
Ld. washt severally, severall servants waiting upon each of
them. Then were brought in 3 little round tables, all of
them were alike, and they were cover’d with leather carpets
onely (without any table cloth); then little flat loafes
of bread (like pancakes) lay’d round in heapes, 3 or 4 one
upon another, and severall broken in peices and scatter’d
upon the table. By each heap, between, lay a coarse little
wooden spoon, four little saucers of capers, olives, sampier,<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
parsley—the two first pickled, the other two in sugar
lickquore—one little salt seller, one little pepper box.
These 3 tables, thus furnisht, stood respectively before the
Vizier, testerdare, Neshargé, all being exactly alike furnished.
At the Vizier’s Table was set a velvet stool for a
seat for my Ld., over against the Vizier, who sat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
bench. Three other such seates were set at the Nesharjé’s
table, where dined Mr. North<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> (the Treasurer), Mr. Hyet
(the antientist merchant here), and Dr. Pickering (a Physician
of Smyrna). Three more were set at the Testerdare’s
table, where dined my Ld.’s Secretary, Mr. Carpenter, Mr.
Cook (the Companyes Councillier), and my self. The
rest of the Merchants and gentlemen dined some in the
next room with the <i>Rice-Effendi</i> and the Vizier’s Secretary.
Some else were with the Chiaus-basha. All our
tables were served exactly alike with just 20 dishes of
meat, which were set on but one at a time; and so soon
as that was scarcely tasted, it was shifted away, and
another placed in the room, so that we made a very
short businesse of it, and, all along, the waiters at each
table kept all so good time, as we began and ended just
together. You must understand the Turkes make the
supper (as the antients did) the best meale, and seldome
eat at noon, but in the morning—and this was about 8½
by the clock. We had a long course Towel layd round
the Table in common (as the fashion is every where) upon
our laps, instead of napkins. It was wrought and
checker’d like a barber’s apron. This was to wipe our
hands, for, by every one, after we were set, on our right hand,
into our lap or on our knee was laid a muckender<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> (of the
same cloth, but finer) to wipe your mouth and beard.</p>

<p>I cannot give you an exact bill of fare, but as well as I
can remember it was thus at every table: first we had 6
rost chickens brought pil’d one upon another, without
sauce; we had no such finicallnesse<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> as knives or forkes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
onely the weapons that nature gave us, our hands and
teeth. The Testerdare began by pinching the flesh with
his fore finger and thumb, and invited us to fall to; I
having seen the way of it many times before, fell on and
brought on my companions. We had a dish of roast
pigeons, which we eat in the same manner, nipping and
tearing them apieces with hands and teeth, in any fashion.
We had <i>Kibôbs</i>, bits of flesh, the first roasted, the last
boyled; this was ready mammockt,<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> and cut to our hands.
We had several sorts of <i>Dolmáh</i>,<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> which is minc’t meat
stuffed into peices of gourds, or gobbeted<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> in vine leaves
or the like, and so boyl’d. We had several <i>Cherbaws</i>,
pottages made of rice, wheat, etc., some sweet, some
savoury; we had <i>Pelo</i>, rice boyled with peices of a hen;
<i>Rice gellyed</i>, a perfect <i>fool</i> in a platter; another slip slop<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> of
Dates and pine kernells; at all these we ployed<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> our wooden
artillery of the spoon. We had a great <i>baked pye</i> in a
platter, with puff paste above and minced beaten meat, wel
season’d underneath; a puf past pudding in a platter,
plain; <i>another</i>, sweeten’d with honey. About half way of
this horse feast we water’d with a hearty draught of
excellent Lemmon sherbert, which was brought in a
<i>fingeon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> or Polish glasse, gilt on the verge at the top. The
Testerdare began, and we caryed it round, then it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
whipt away, and we saw it no more. We had my Ld.’s 2d
Dragoman by us all the time, and the 1st Dragoman and
<i>Mauro Cordato</i>, dragoman to the Vizier, attended my Ld.
I sat so near him as I could have touched him, and I heard
every word that past betwixt the Vizier and him, which
was not much, but what it was was nothing of private
businesse, but newes or such discourse; all past pleasantly.</p>

<p>The onely thing of notice was this: talking of the stirres
that have been made at <i>Fustenberg</i>,<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> between the Emperor
and K. of France, the Vizier, laughing, askt why they did
not cut of his head at first? then, says he, there had been
an end of all the embroglios that happen’d after. We
were all served alike in costly (lordly) dishes, which are used
every where at court, and I saw them at the Vizier’s and
Mosaïf’s houses. They come from India, and are all in
use in Persia, for the G. Sr. nor any great Turkes can use
silver dishes by their law. They call the mettal of them
<i>Martabáni</i><a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>; they are very dear and much heavier (in
proportion) then China, which they call <i>Phorphoré</i> (I
suppose from πόρφωρα); their platters, which they call
<i>Taback</i>,<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> of <i>Martábani</i>, are worth some of them 200
dollars. China is not half so dear here; your little
sherbert cups and coffee dishes are made often times of
the same earth; they ring like a bell; the earth is
darkish, but the outside glazed colour is greenish. The
last dish being taken from table, we all rose up together;
the Grandees washt, and then my Ld. and me with him
were caryed into the gallery, and there he sat on a long
bench. Presently we were vested with Caphtans, which we
wore all the time we were afterwards in the Seraglio; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
were given but 19 in all; my Ld. Harvey had 22 when he
was at Salonica, and the G. Sr. spoke to him a great deal;
but now (as you shall hear immediately) he said not one
word.</p>

<p>The meat which went from our tables was caryed out
amongst inferior officers, where was such scrambling as I
never saw. I saw much, much better order once at a feast
at the Kaimacham’s of Stambol. The like was where our
servants dined; yet all passed in silence, as the whole
businesse above said was likewise acted even to a miracle,
all being done with a nod or private sign (at which they are
the best in the world) to the attendants and waiters, who
stand like images with their hands acrosse before them.
The same silence, gravity, and decorum is alwayes practised
in all other places of justice or businesse throughout the
whole Empire; <i>whish</i>, <i>whish</i>, <i>whish</i>, <i>whish</i>, or <i>kish</i>, <i>kish</i>,
etc., is sometimes used if there should happen any the least
<i>cavgá</i>, or disturbance. The Merchants that din’d without
said some of them were hunch’t<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> about and <i>Heyda’d</i><a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> (a word
which signifies <i>get you gon’</i>) with some rudenesse, as I am
apt enough to beleive the rabble Turkes are like enough to
do it.</p>

<p>After my Ld. and we had weighted about ½ an hour in the
gallery, where Mauro Cordato had the impudence to sit by
my Ld., the Vizier and the rest rose and past by us, and went
into the G. Sr., who was in a low room. There was another
doore going into some other room, and forwards run a
high wall to the corner of the court. A quarter of an hour
after they past by, my Ld. was cal’d; all we accompanyed
him almost to the outward door, then he went forward with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
onely six persons who were appointed to accompany him,
viz., the two chief Dragomen, Mr. North the Treasurer, Mr.
Hyet the eldest merchant, my Ld.’s Secretary, who carry’d
the king’s letter upon his head, and the Companyes
Cancelleer.</p>

<p>My Ld. and Sr. Thos. B. promised me before we set out
from <i>Stambol</i>, and all along assured me, that I should infallibly
be one that should goe in, and no lesse then three
dayes before did again secure me the same favour; but it
happen’d otherwise on some other occasion, which I shall
afterwards make you laugh withall. For my own part I
repine not at it, for I have seen the G. Sr. again and again,
and those that did goe in can onely say they did do so;
for as to any thing that they saw there, the divel of any the
least account could they give; onely something look’t like
a thing they call the G. Sr.; yet the whole account I coul’d
get from them, or observe myself, is this fully and exactly.
My Ld. and all the rest were led in by two <i>Peskeshjes</i> or
<i>Chiauses</i>, one holding them under one arme, the other
under the other, through the part of the court were we left
them. So soon as ever they entered the room, their
leaders, laying their hands upon their necks, bowed them
down (my Ld. himselfe very low, the rest to the very
ground); immediately Mr. North, Mr. Hyet, and the
Cancelleir and the 2d Dragoman were hurryed out again
so soon, as Mr. North, who was first, swore he observed
nothing, onely in general that it was a very rich room, but
in particular he remembred nothing in the world. The poor
Cancellier, being a little man, was crushed quite down at
the entrance, and Mr. Hyet had like to tumble over him as
he lay sprawling on the ground: so they saw lesse then Mr.
North. The Cancellier remember’d nothing, and Mr. Hyet
said he had a pittyfull glance at the G. Sr., and indeed it
was impossible they could look about them, these thre
gentlemen being in (at that outward door, where we lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
sight of them) but 48 of my pulses, which is not much
above ½ a minute, as I have tryed by a half minute glasse
at sea severall times. My Ld. stay’d after them about 200
of my pulses, so that in all he could not be there much
above 4 minutes at most. He being led in and bowed (as
is said) <i>pro more</i>, the chief Dragoman read his speech (and
yet was out about the middle of it, as my Ld. himselfe
told him before me afterwards), which I saw and was just
12 lines and a half in a small quarter of a sheet. That
ended, the Secretary gave the king’s letter to the Dragoman,
and he to the Vizier, and he lay’d it by the G. Sr.’s
right hand upon his bolster, who cast a kind of scornful
eye towards it. The Vizier immediately told them: It’s
well, and he as Vikiel or deputy should take care of their
businesse; and so, without one word or complement passing,
they were all led out again. This my Ld. himself told me,
and his Secretary and Dragoman confirm’d it.</p>

<p>Now for grandeur and state of what was there, my Ld.
himself gave us this account. The G. Sr. was set leaning
upon a bed, and had put on a most severe, terrible, stately
look. The bed had four posts, like ours, but whether with
silk curtaines, valence, etc., is not sayd. The counterpane
was of crimson velvet embroyder’d and flour’d with
pearl, and round the edges went eight rowes of the same,
all as bigge and as fair as ever he saw in a necklace.
The floor was crimson sattin, embroyder’d likewise and
wrought with gold wire, which in some places was very
big. The G. Sr. had a small, plain Turbant on, with
a little feather in it; at the bottome it had a brooch of
Jewels, amongst the rest one very large diamond. At the
feet of his bed stood a large cabinet all cover’d over with
jewels, which he first valued at 100,000<i>li.</i> (but in a second
relation at 200,000<i>li.</i>) sterling; he judged it to be full of
jewels. His vest and delamon,<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> from his neck down before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
were all set with fair large diamonds and pearles. What
the roof of the room had, the walls, windowes, and the
like had, or whether there were chimney, chimney-piece,
balconyes, stooles, chayres, etc., he could give no account;
onely he said he thought the windore was but small, for
the room was dark, so as he wonder’d the old Dragoman
could read at all. You were out a little (quoth he to him),
but you soon recover’d yourself; in fine, my Ld. said in
generall that it was the richest room for certain in the
whole world; but I question much whether he could make
out the particulars.</p>

<p>Now I declare to you the chief thing I desired to see
was the furniture and embellishments of the room; for (as
is said) I have seen the G. Sr. again and again. Here are
adornments in building very costly and comely, utterly
unknown in our parts of the world, of which I am able to
give some pretty account; perhaps the sight of this might
have added something to my observations. So soon as
my Ld. come out, we all accompanyed him through the
great court to the outer gate. There we mounted, and
stay’d about half-an-houre, till the Vizier and Testerdare
came out; after them came out all the <i>Chiauses</i>, who
again conducted us out of the Town.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 10th.</i> My Ld. went to visit the Mufti. He had
audience, in the very same manner as before is said, with
the G. Vizier<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>; and, after a little formall complimenting,
we return’d. He was a swarthy man, yet a good-natured
countenance; his beard somewhat grey (being above 54
yeares old, as is commonly said), the left corner something
longer than the other; a full eye, lean, discreet nose, well-fashioned
mouth and teeth; his forehead of a middle
height; serene brow, cheekes enclining to leanesse; but no
wayes a mortifyed look. He gave us no vests, but received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
ours (which we alwayes caryed wherever we went to audience)
gladly; and without doubt that added to his cheer,
which was very pleasant, as well as his countenance. He
was set <i>Alla Turchesca</i>, with his feet cover’d and lapt with
a course kind of linesay-woolsay blanket; the rest of his
habit was no wayes distinguist from that of a common
Turk. We were carryed into him, and he did not rise to
my Ld., but onely bow’d; and my Ld. was placed on a
stool just before him. He had three or 4 bookes lay’d by
him, and round about the room on shelf lay severall more.
His turbant in the middle being plain, and not in folds.
We did not stay much above a quarter of an hour with
him; soe we return’d to our old shop at Caragatch.
Remember that these visits were in the height of the
Plague; and several, I assure you, came amongst us with
plague-sores running upon them at the Vizier’s at our
last audience, of which by and by. There was a fellow
gave me a dish of coffee who had then about him 2
filthy sores; and after he had served us with coffee, by
chance talking with some of our Merchants (that spoke
Turkish) about the plague, told them that he had lost
three children the week before, and that he had been sick
unto death, but now his swellings were broke he was much
better. The Turkes used no other antidote against the
plague then multitudes of Issues, which really I count
a most divine thing to that effect, though otherwise a plague
in themselves.</p>

<p>I have above mentioned to you <i>Vani Effendi</i>, the great
preacher amongst the Turkes.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> I shall here insert some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
little notices of him. He is an old huncht-back man, very
gray, a crabb’d countenance, yet his shrivel’d flesh is clear,
not black or swarthy, but pale; and Nature hath marked
him in the face, for his right eye is lesse than his left, as if
it were shrunk. He hath children at Brussa,<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> and is of
such authority amongst the Turkes, as about 6 yeares
since preach’d down all publick Tavernes and ale-houses,
and the Dervises’ publick meetings; yet I believe there
is as much wine drunk (or more) and as many tavernes by
connivance and bribery as ever there was. The fame of
this old cox comb is more then a Pope amongst them;
he invited Sr. Thos. Baines to visite him; therefore,
sending one of our dragomen and <i>Renegado Boccareschi</i>
to beg licence of him to come, he told them he should
be wellcome. He is cal’d <i>Vani</i>, from a town of that
name on the confines of Persia.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Sr. Tho. being come
to him and set down, ask’t liberty of discourse; he told
him he might say what he pleased, nothing would be taken
amiss.</p>

<p>Sr. Tho. 1st Quest. was: Whether all soules were equall
of men, women, children? After many shuffling answers,
he said the prophet Mahomet was asked the same question,
and answered it was <i>not yet revealed to him</i>.</p>

<p>2dly: Whether women shall be in Paradice? Answr.:
They shall have many there of those which were here and
lived well and virtuously according to their law, and besides
God will create them many others; but of the two sortes,
those that go from hence will be the better, because their
obedience hath already been tryed and proved. He said
that wicked men commonly drew their wives down to hell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
with them; yet if the wife be virtuous she may goe to
heaven, though the Man goes to Hell.</p>

<p>Now I understande one notion of my own. Being once
with our chief Dragoman in company with a great Doctor
of their law, I had the curiosity to ask (amongst other
things) what use they should have of women in Paradice,
whether for procreation or no? He told me that they shall
conceive there for certain, but not by members of generation,
but onely by intellectual seed and spiritually, to make a
spirituall ofspring. <i>Vaní</i> told Sr. Thos. that there is a
middle life or place cal’d (as Sr. Tho. hath set it down)
<i>Asaph</i> (it should be Aráf,<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> as in the chapter of Prisons,
cap. 7), whither all that have lived a middle life shall goe;
that is, sins and virtuous deeds being compared and weighed
together.</p>

<p>3d: What people might be suffer’d to live amongst
Turkes? Answr.: None but Jewes and Christians; all
other are to be put to death. This toleration is given,
because the Jewes had and yet have a true law, but most
imperfect Christians have a true and perfecter law; but the
onely perfect law is Mahomet’s, which all now are bound to
believe and follow; if they doe not, though they live never
so well, they cannot be saved. There were two little boyes
(by Christian slaves), and Sr. Tho. put this case: If you had
lost (it had been better put if he had said hidden) a jewell, and
should bid these two seek it, and tell them where abouts it
was to be found; one being more successful then the other,
finds it; the other notwithstanding being very industrious,
and leaving no stone or stick unturned, perhaps finds onely
a crisstall: shall this son be blamed for his ill successe,
notwithstanding his indeavours were as much, perhaps more
then the other? Here, saith Sr. Tho. B., the teares stood
in his eyes, and he answered: Every body had heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
their law and their Prophet, and were bound to believe.
Sr. Tho. B. said he had heard many things which he
now found not truly reported of them, and he had read
their Alcoran, which he now sees wrongly translated;
both which rather prejudic’d him then furthered him in
his belief, and many there are who never heard of it at
all; suppose such a one (who never heard) to be a
Christian and live well, whether he might be saved?
He answer’d not close to the point. Sr. Tho. told what
kind of Christian he was, viz., he would rather dye then
worship either crosse, Pictures, Images, or the like. He
adored onely one true God, and lived in his fear onely;
he believed a Mussulman, living up to the height of his
law, may be undoubtedly saved. He thought himselfe
obliged (though it was never so absolutely in his power
to do it) not to touch a hair of a Mussulman’s head
for his difference in religion, but rather to help, assist,
relieve, and cherish them in every good office that he was
able to doe for them. Here Sr. Th. B. saies he wept, and
said he could not believe any Christian came so near true
Musselmen, but that they all had been Idolaters; and the
standers by (which were many) cryed out <i>E Adám</i><a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>—he was
a <i>Good Man</i>. You may imagine this was odde for a Greek
(who worships all these things, and curses a Turk to the
Divel) to say as Draggerman. <i>Vaní</i> pressing the perfection
of his law, and the necessity of turning to it, Sr. Tho. said
he was now about 55 years of age, and his bones were dryed
and hardened to their forme; and his understanding was
in like manner settled by long practice of his own religion,
and it would be a hard task, and of some long time, to
unrivet his notions. Vaní bad him welcome, desired more
frequent converse, assuring him all security and freedome.
The Dragoman told me he was afraid to speak, for though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
they might not touch Sr. Tho. B., yet they might chastise
him for speaking anything about or against this Law.</p>

<p>Sr. Tho. Baines went no more; he sent to him severall
questions by <i>Boccareschi</i>, till he was weary, first: To know
if the soules of the dead (Men and Women) went immediately
to heaven or hell, without any stay? Answr.:
The blessed went not into Paradice till the day of Judgement,
but had a continuall sight of it through a great
windore. He said <i>Boccareschi</i> was not a fitting messenger,
and desir’d, if he had any more questions, that he might set
them down in writing, and he would answer in like manner.
Sr. Th. B. left of. For my own part, I believe he might
have given his first Answer to most of Sr. Th. B.’s questions,
viz.: The Prophet (nor God himself) hath not revealed those
things. He sent word by <i>Boccareschi</i> about Hell: 1st,
there are 60 mountaines of fire, and millions of poysonous
serpents and dragons to torment the damned. 2nd, that
no Turke shall remain there to eternity; infidells and
Idolaters never get out.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 8th.</i> My Ld. went for the capitulations to the
Vizier, and, to take leave, we were caryed into the Khiá’s
(the Steward or Secretaryes) chamber, where we stay’d
waiting two houres. We were treated in the mean time
with coffee and sherbert. Mauro Cordato<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> (the Vizier’s
Dragoman), who has studyed in Italy, and was at first a
doctor of Physick, by nation a Greek, sat and bore my Ld.
company. Amongst other discourse, he assured us that
the first month (June) the plague began, there might die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
from 60 to 100 per diem; the 2d month it increased to
at least 250; this month (Sept.) dyed at least 600 per
diem (but others talked much lighter), and after our coming
away it increased to double the number. It is a very
bad place for fruits, and this year worse than ever. He
said that it was banisht the court. There were abundance
of Turkes, and many of them sick (as is above said), intermixt
with us. At last we were caryed into another room,
and, after a little pause, came in the Vizier, and he and my
Ld. sat as before. He spoke cheerfully, and proved in very
good humour; yet his face, especially about the eyes,
look’d very swel’d and reddish. We understood he had
been soundly <i>keiph’t</i> the night before.</p>

<p>The Vizier began, and told him the Capitulations were
renewed according to his desire. My Ld. thankt him,
and signifyed what high respect our king would have for
him for his particular care in it; and he would see that he
had particular thanks for it from him. The Vizier ask’t
what ships we had, and what were expected. Answer:
Two dayly expected from Legorne, one generall ship in
two months at Constantinople, 2 more at Smyrna. The
Vizier ask’t what newes? Answer: The last was that the two
Armyes were within 2 or three leagues one of the other,
and that Brandenburgh had routed the Swead; that the
Ragusian Ambassador reported a battle to have been
fought, wherein 12,000 French, with Turein<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> himself, kil’d.
The Vizier said he had heard the like. We had 12 vests.
My Ld. received the Capitulations, G. Sr.’s letter, and
Vizier’s letter to our king from his own hand, kissing them
all, as the manner is. My host wish’t the G. Sr. and
Vizier a long life, and that the Vizier might have all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
increase of honour and favour with the G. Sr. And so we
came away.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 16th.</i> My Ld. took leave of the Vizier’s <i>Khia</i> and
the <i>Rice effendi</i>, in whose familyes the plague was then
very, very rife. Two men, with plague sores on them running,
stood about a full quarter of an houre within a yard
of him, yet God preserved both him and us. Onely, as is
said, three or four servants dyed there. One or two had
it all the way home to Stambole undiscovered, and there
one, who allwayes was about my Ld. and Sr. Tho., dyed.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 19th.</i> About 1 o’clock we set out for Stambole.
Because the road was everywhere full of the plague, we
every night lay in our Tents, which were caryed before us,
and pitcht ready at every <i>conáck</i>, and all our waggons and
coaches were drawn round us, and a great fire being made.
There were men watch’t by turnes every night, for the
road was very full of thieves. Not a day past but some
newes or other came of their exploits. There were many
in companyes, and if we had not had guards it would
have been very easy cutting our throats. We made as
many dayes coming home as we did going out, and
pitcht under the same town sides; so that though we ourselves
went not into Townes, most of our waggoners and
servants did for wine, or women, or something or other,
and so our danger was, in a manner, the same. I have
been used to the fashion of the country of lying in my
clothes, which I did both outwards and homewards, and
once in a frolick to Brusa Baths I came not in a bed for 8
weekes together. Now I caryed a little sea bed with me,
which I lay on at Adrianople, and upon the road. We first
spread a carpet on the ground, and then lay’d our beds or
quilts upon it, and so tumbled down upon them, booted,
cloak’t, etc., as we rode. I was a little ill at Caragatch, or
else I enjoy’d my health very well all the time. I came
with my Ld. and companye along to <i>Caresteran</i>. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
I left them with onely my man with me (wee were well
arm’d) to go see <i>Misine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> At Chiorlúh I met my Ld. and
all the Company again.</p>

<p><i>Sept 24th.</i> Seeing the Sea from Chiorlúh, I thought it
not much out of my way to goe to it, and thence to
Selibria alongst the sea shore. I could perswade no man
to accompany me for fear of Thieves, and a calf with a
white face disheartened them all. Away went my man
and I. There is from Chiorlúh, to your eye, a perfect
streight valley to the Sea, which I thought was, at most
within 5 miles, but I was horribly mistaken. Though in a
right line it may be so, yet following a road that leads to
it, by reason of a little rill that rises on the left hand out
of the hills towards <i>Stambol</i>, which makes a moorish bottome,
by windings and turnings I made it about as much
more. This little rill, in most places, is so very narrow as
I could easily step over it, and yet we reckon’d 7 or 8
Turkish mills upon it, so little water sufficing for each of
them. In 2¼ houres we got to the sea, counting it at least
9 mile, all the hills on either side (especially the left)
covered with vineyards, and they were then in the height
of their vintage. We past severall very good fountaines
in the way, and about a mile of the sea we past a little
Turkish village. So soon as we arriv’d at the sea, we
turn’d to the left hand for Heraclea. At the end of about
6 mile we met a good fountaine, which refresh’t us well.
The country all champion, and many little villages were
to our left hand on the hanging hills. We arriv’d at
Heraclea in 2½ houres. At our rate it was about 13 or 14
miles, the country still champion, onely some few trees
thinly set about Heraclea. In the playnes are many hills
raysed (as sepulchres, I suppose). One large one is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the sea, upon a rising ground, not far from the town. It
stands upon a peninsula. The Isthmus is on the N.W.
side. To the sea is a pretty high cliff. On that upper
ground stood the antient town, now inhabited most by
Greekes. On the lower ground to the Isthmus live many
Turkes, and have severall Moschés. There are yet standing,
in all, 40 Greek churches, yet (as elsewhere) none
deserve the name but the Metropole’s, which is a good
old odde fashion’d building. It hath a Cupola and half
cupolas about it like Sta. Sophia.</p>

<p>They show there, within the Metropolis, the top stone of
Sta. Gluceria’s tomb, which they say was saved out of her
monastery, which stood hard by, but was ruin’d and most
part tumbled into the Sea. It is pure white marble, about
a foot thick, most neatly covered and hollowed on the
edges, with a coronite<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> round the head, and at the feet with
two spires. At the head there is cut an archt hole, in
which they say her head was kept; and there is a hole
sideways of it which is like a saucer, and in the bottome
of it is in another small one, out of which they say continually
issued an holy oyle. All this arch’t hole was
cover’d with a plate of gold; the pins that fasten’d it yet
remain. I assure you the whole thing is absolutely the
curiosest piece of work that is to be found in Greece of so
modern artifice. On the upper side, between the arch’t
hole and the bottome, rose an inscription in impure Iambick.
It was wrote in a moderne character, which is very
difficult to be read, and the latter end of each verse was
wrote under the former part in very much smaller letters.
I verily believe this whole thing was but a piece of Greekish
monkery, and they might have some pretty contrivance to
let oyl, or the like liquor, drop upon occasion, to work some
miracle upon the credulous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Greeks’ Hierology they observe the 23d of May<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
as a great holy day to her memory, and say that she was
martyrd in the times of Antoninus, by his Proconsul
Sabinus; that she was torn apieces by wild beasts, and
afterwards translated to Heraclea. I am sure the story
and the inscription savours of no such antiquity. This
church is dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, and is
generally called τῶν μεγάλων ἀποστόλων. The Metropolite
has very good accommodations there for himself and his
<i>papas</i>. Below, in the cloyster, just at the foot of the staires
going up to the Metropolite’s apartment, lyes buryed Mr.
Edward Wych, brother to Sr. Peter,<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> who was Embassadore
here. He went with our chief Dragoman (yet living) to
Scio to meet Sr. Peter’s Lady, then coming out of England
to her husband; and, coming back, he touched at Tenedos,
where the plague was very rife, and he got it and dyed, and
was brought here and buryed, 1628.</p>

<p>Coming out of the Greekes’ apartment, we went into
St. George’s church (whome they call ἃγιος Γεώργιος),
who is here reverenced as the greatest Saint imaginable,
and they attribute many miracles to his image, which is
a head cut flat in wood and trimm’d up with abundance of
tinsel stuff; the candles have made it as black as soot.
The chief thing he is famed for is the deliverance of poor
mariners, and in the church was hang’d up to him infinites
of ἀναθήματα, dedicated by poor creatures which had
escaped shipwreck: most are little short pieces of halsers
or cables, or smal ropes, having one end tipt with silver.</p>

<p>Upon the cliff to the S.E. stand 4 or 5 windmills immoveable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and are driven onely by the Embaty,<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> which
never failes in the daye time to come of from the sea.</p>

<p>I came from <i>Selibria</i> home with the rest. The Plague
had been as hot at Stambol all last summer, and after our
returne (which was Sept. 27th) it encreased. Upon the
death of the foot boy in our house (of whom is above
written), my Ld. and Sr. Tho., with 4 servants, withdrew
to a house out of town. I took the opportunity at that
time to go with some gentlemen of Smyrna (who had
been at audience with us) as farre as Brusa, where the
G. Sr. baths are; and indeed it is a brave place. I took
some delight upon mount <i>Olympus Mysiæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> which is very,
very high, and over looks the town; it is alwayes cover’d
with snowe, as it was then whilst we were on the top of it.
I took notice of many fine plants, trees, and other curiosyties
there, as likewise about the Town and at the baths; and
should certainly have been highly pleased with my voyage,
had not a sad accident embitter’d all to me. One of the
gentlemen, my dear friend, fell sick of a very high feavor:
we fear’d it was the Plague. All the rest of the company
left me and my man alone with him; and after 13 dayes
he dyed there. I was ill treated by the Turkes; but I got
leave to bury him with much adoe; and, writing to my
Ld., I had a Chiaus and Dragoman came and chastised
those Rogues very handsomely. I spent a month there,
and have made remarques of many things; but I must
leave the story of that and all the rest to another time to
tell you by letter or word of mouth.</p>

<p>I will see Nice,<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Nicomedia, Cyzicus, Mount Athos,
Lemnos, Lesbos, Chios, and what else lyes in my way before
I leave the countrey, though I shall make Inscriptions and
such knackes but onely my passe time. Here are every year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
abundance of Whiflers<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> in those scraps of learning. Last
year were here one Mr. Wheeler, a pretty ingenious youth,
our countryman, and one Mr. Le Spon,<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> a Frenchman,
who certainely have made the best collection in the world,
and intends to print them when he comes home. He hath
gathered up and down at least 10,000 that never yet saw
light in Greek or any other author. I have a very great
intimacy with him, and maintein a strickt correspondency
with him, and I shall certainely give him all I have which
he wants; and I am sure I have one or two very rare, and
not met with all by him. Here is now one Mr. Vernon
(lately Secretary to Mr. Montague in France), who is
mightily eager after all such things, and is going for
Persia. So the main businesse will be caryed on by
others, to the satisfaction of themselves, if not of others.
For my own part, my heat and leachery after such things
was soon over after I arrived in these places. But, when
all is done, they goe but on the skirts of Asia all of them;
whereas from hence to Aleppo, and all about Ancyra, and
on the other side in Caria, etc., are the statelyest things in
the world, and in very great numbers. He that thinks
them worth his labour and expence and hazard, let him go
fetch them; yet I confesse I have an itching after them,
for I can assure you there are some things that will give
great light to Church story, especially as to the Arians,
Basilidians,<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> and other Heriticks. It is very troublesome
to transcribe what I have collected; I must be pardoned
herein till I see you. In the mean time, I joyn absolutely
with you in your opinion of that part of learning, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
your censure of the professors of it. I have two or three
pretty knackes which I have lighted upon very cheap, and
yet I vallue them dear. I have a delicate cat’s eye; two
or three <i>Seraphims</i>; two little cupids holding a lyon,
imbossed admirably in a <i>Cameo</i>; severall petrifyed mushroomes;
tiles; etc.</p>

<p>In truth, I am now weary, and I believe so are you by
this time. I cannot read these papers over to correct
them. You are my Friend: for your sake I have scribbled
them at full gallop; for my sake passe by whatever is
amisse, or twice over, or rudely and carelessly done. I
did all to testify what you shall ever find—Fidum pectus
amicitiae. You must communicate them to Sam. Th.;
and for others I leave it to your discretion who you shall
admitte to see my levityes. It would be some passetime
to T. Fairmeddow over a pot of ale; but use your discretion.
I shall tell him I have wrote you at large. Now,
Dear friend, the Mighty God of heaven and Earth watch
over us for our good; and, if it be his blessed will, bring
us together once more. I am,</p>

<p>The two volumes of Dr. Covel’s consecutive diary terminate
with his visit to Adrianople. There are, however,
several smaller diaries of different journeys, which would be
too long to insert here. One is thus headed:</p>

<h4><i>Feb. 16, 1676/7.</i>—<span class="smcap">Our Voyage to Nicomedia, Nicæa, etc.</span></h4>

<p>Dr. Covel sailed up the Gulf of Ismidt, and, on arriving
at the town of Ismidt (Nicomedia), he was “nobly lodged
at the monastery by Greeks”. He speaks in quaint terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of the numerous ἁγιάσματα, or sacred springs, at Ismidt,
and describes more particularly one dedicated to St. Anne,
and its supposed healing qualities.</p>

<p>“I saw”, he writes, “a man who, last 2nd of February,
went to St. Anne’s ἁγίασμα for cure, being full of ulcers,
and could receive no benefit otherwayes but washing all
over. His ulcers were dryed up in less than a fortnight’s
time, which made me reflect upon the story of Naaman.”</p>

<p>“<i>Feb. 22.</i> Got to Isnick (Nicæa), which is not now
within the walls, a third part inhabited, or filled with
houses, most being gardens or yards enclosed with mud
walls. I do not remember that I saw one tolerably good
house in the town; and most were intolerably bad, little,
pittyfull, low, dirty hovels, instead of houses.”</p>

<p>As usual, Dr. Covel’s narrative is full of archæology, and
as he only stopped one day at Nicæa, it is marvellous how
much he saw and put down.</p>

<p>“If I had had any instrument in the world to have taken
a plain angle withall, I should have plotted down everything
exactly. Now I have done it by guesse and loose
calculation, and let that suffice.”</p>

<p>On his return journey he visited the islands of Prinkipo
and Chalcis. He was on this latter on Feb. 25, and visited
the celebrated monastery there.</p>

<p>“This monastery about 5 or 6 yeares since, was unfortunately
burnt down, and Panagiotes<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> (the late Vizier’s
Dragoman), who lyes buryed here, rebuilt it at his own
cost.”</p>

<p>“Our first ambassador, Sir Edw. Barton, lyes buried
without the outward gate, to the right hand. His armes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
are rudely done, but I take them to be three stagges heads
above. It was cut by a Turk, and thence came all the
mistakes in the writing, and at the bottome are three
Cypress trees, which are commonly put on the Turks’
tombs.”<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>On April 2nd, 1677, Dr. Covel left Constantinople for
good, and his return journey to England forms another
MS. volume. He thus begins it:</p>

<p>“This day, in the year 1638, I was born at two o’clock
in the morning, being Monday, and it pleased me to see so
many things meet this day, whereby I might reckon it my
second birth. Just at two o’clock Antonio called us to go
to the Alloy. This day I left Stamboul, which, for many
reasons, I may well liken to the prison of my mother’s
belly.”</p>

<p>Dr. Covel and Sir John Finch, the ambassador, started
together on the <i>Alloy</i>, and the new Grand Vizier, Kara
Mustapha,<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> came to see them off, and brought them “large
quantities of presents, and grand accompaniment.”</p>

<p>The homeward diary is very much scamped and badly
written, but there are interesting passages in it. He gives
us a good description of Cyzicus and the temple of Nemesis
therein, and his account of Mt. Athos is also valuable,
though prolix. The ship <i>Alloy</i> then came to the island of
Lemnos, “where we lay weather fast.” Dr. Covel here
gives us an interesting account of what he saw in connection
with the <i>terra Sigillata</i> of Lemnos, the sacred
earth with supposed curative properties, a superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
which has survived since the days of Galen, and still exists,
so I will give Dr. Covel’s description in full.</p>

<p>“On the side hills, on the contrary side of the valley,
directly over against the middle point betwixt this hill and
Παναγιά κοτζινὰτζ, is the place where they dig the <i>terra
sigillata</i>. At the foot of a hard rock of grey hard freestone
enclining to marble is a little clear spring of most
excellent water, which, falling down a little lower, looseth
its water in a kind of milky bogge; on the East side of
this spring, within a foot or my hand’s breadth of it, they
every year take out the earth on the 6th of August, about
three houres after the sun. Several papas, as well as
others, would fain have persuaded me that, at the time of
our Saviour’s transfiguration, this place was sanctifyed to
have his virtuous earth, and that it is never to be found
soft and unctuous, but always perfect rock, unlesse only
that day, which they keep holy in remembrance of the
Metamorphosis, and at that time when the priest hath said
his liturgy; but I believe they take it onely that day, and
set the greater price upon it by its Scarcenesse. Either it
was the Venetian, or perhaps Turkish policy<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> for the
Grand Signor to engrosse it all to himselfe, unless some
little, which the Greekes steal; and they prefer no poor
Greek to take any for his own occasions, for they count it
an infallible cure of all agues taken in the beginning of the
fit with water, and drank so two or three times. Their
women drink it to hasten childbirth, and to stop the fluxes
that are extraordinary; and they count it an excellent
counter-poyson, and have got a story that no vessel made
of it will hold poison, but immediately splinter in a thousand
pieces. I have seen several finganes (Turkish cups)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
made of it in Stamboul; we had a good store of it
presented to us by Agathone and others, all incomparably
good. We had some such as it is naturally dig’d out and
not wash’d. (There is no such chappel nigh as Bel talked
of, called Sobiranon, to be found, unless he took Παναγιά
κοτζινὰτζ for it.) Thus they take it out: before day they
begin and digge a well about 1½ yards wide, and a little
above a man’s height deep; and then the earth is taken
out soft and loomy, some of it like butter, which the
Greeks say, and the Turks believe, is turned out of rocky
stone into soft clay by virtues of their mass. When they
have taken out some 20 or 30 kintals for the Greeks’ use,
they fill it up again, and so leave it stop’t without any
guard in the world....</p>

<p>“We came down to a town called Hagiapate, where
there is a great large fountain, where they wash and
prepare the ἅγιον χώμα (sacred earth) for the Turkish seal.
They first dissolve it in water, well working it with their
hands; then let the water pass through a sive, and what
remains they throw away. They let the water stand till
settled, then take of the clear, and, when dry enough, they
mould in their hands; and most of this we have is shaped
from thence. It is all here white, yet I had some given
me flesh-coloured. I enquired diligently about it, and
they all told me it came out of the same pit; but I expect
some of these fellows have found some other place which
they conceal. We had some little quantity given us of
several people, but very privately, for fear of the <i>Avaniás</i>.
Agathone, being the Pasha’s favourite, feared nothing, but
gave us at least 20 okes before 20 people. They tell
a story that the earth is hollow from the holy well, when
dig’d, to the fountain, where they wash it; and that
a duck once dived in the water there and was taken up
here; but it seemed an impossible thing to me, there being
not water enough in the first place to cover a duck, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the water in the bogge so very shallow, and the earth not
sinuous.”</p>

<p class="tb">Dr. Covel’s remarks on the sacred earth of Lemnos are
particularly valuable, as this is one of the clearest instances
of a pagan superstition being carried on through the influence
of Christianity down to our own times. Pliny mentions
it (<i>Hist. Nat.</i>, 29, 5); also Dioscorides (<i>De Mater.
Med.</i>, 5, 113); and Galen made an expedition to Lemnos
on purpose to see it, and gives us an account of it (<i>De
Simpl. Med.</i>, 9, 2, vol. xii). He mentions the disorders for
which it was considered beneficial; he also gives us the
ceremonies and mode of operation; on certain occasions a
priestess of Artemis came, and, after certain rites, carried off
a cartload to the city; she mixed it with water, kneaded
it, and strained off both the moisture and gritty particles,
and, when it was like wax, she impressed it with the seal of
Artemis. During the Middle Ages, the reputed virtues of
this earth remained unimpaired as a remedy for the plague.
Belon saw it in the sixteenth century (<i>Observations de
plusieurs singulaires</i>, p. 51). Here we have Dr. Covel’s
account of it in the seventeenth century. Conze was able
to buy specimens of it in 1858; but Dr. Tozer, who visited
Lemnos three years ago, writes of it as an expiring superstition.
In that year only twelve persons were present at
the ceremony; and the Turkish governor, seeing so small
a prospect of revenue, has ceased to be present in person.
Dr. Tozer could not even obtain a specimen in a chemist’s
shop; but the superstitious in remote parts of the island
still use it.</p>

<p>Proceeding from Lemnos, the <i>Alloy</i> went to Chios,
where Dr. Covel gives us an account of the silk-trade
carried on there, and the growth of the mastic, and the
<i>avanias</i> thereon imposed by the Turkish Government.
“The poor sort of Greek women dayly scold and quarrell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and pull one another’s head gear of,<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> then in a fury run to
Turkish justice; and, in conclusion, both pay soundly,
though the richest purse always speeds best.”</p>

<p>When passing between Chios and the island of Psara,
Dr. Covel tells two curious nautical yarns. “<i>The Plymouth</i>,
which caryed my Lord Winchilsea to Stambol, passing
between these two islands, strook twice or thrice upon
a blind rock, and a great peice broke of, and stuck in the
keel of the ship, and continued in quite till she returned to
England, and was found when she came to be carin’d.
The peice is now kept in the king’s closet. Captain
Blake told me that a ship coming from the E. Indyes, the
Doctor was very kind to a sick mariner, who thereupon
made the Dr. his heir; he, tempted thereby, gave him
something to sleep, and, taking opportunity, thrust in
a small needle or bodkin under his ear, and kil’d him. He
was thrown over board, and three days after, sayling with
a very stiff gale, they spyed his body floting under the
weather bow; as fast as the ship could make way, it kept
pace. With wonder they took it up, and, after many
consultations, the Captain came himself first and touch’t
it; when the Dr. came, the blood spirt out of the dead
man’s nose and the wound under his ear, upon him: he
confest all, and was brought home and hang’d.”</p>

and crossed Italy and France on his way to England.</p>

<p>“On Monday morning, Jan. 20th, 1679, we got over to
Dover in four houres just; that night to Canterbury;
next night to London.”</p>

<p>At the end of his <i>Diary</i> there is this curious note on
a London fog:—“Feb. 12, 1679, was Black Sunday; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
dark about 9 or 10 o’clock for about ½ an hour, as candles
were lighted in most churches in London. It is thought
it came partly from a misty thick air, partly from a very
black, thick cloud, which, being low, hindered in the third
place the smoke to rise high, which increased the thickness
of the air. I am informed the like hath been often before.
Mr. Standish was lighted home with a torch at 3 in the
afternoon.”</p>

under the command of Captain Harris. The <i>Bonaventure</i> was also 300
tons, Captain Childie. Dallam here distinguishes between the
merchant ship <i>Bonaventure</i> and the Queen’s ship <i>Edward Bonaventure</i>:
this latter ship and the <i>Swallow</i> were both probably those
engaged in the destruction of the Spanish Armada, when the <i>Bonaventure</i>
was commanded by Captain Regmon and the <i>Swallow</i> by
Captain Hawkins. The <i>Bonaventure</i> appears in the list of many of

Hammer). The Turks took advantage of the position, increased the
taxes, and utterly crushed the place. In 1678, one Ragusan Ambassador
was put to death, another put in prison, and 200,000 crowns
demanded from the inhabitants.</p>

Teutonic myth, <i>Jack the Giant-killer</i>, to be found in the earliest
annals of our race. An old ballad, written in 1630, commences
thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In Arthur’s court Tom Thumb did live,</div>

<div class="verse">Then thinke you not this little knight</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Was proved a valiant man.”</div>
</div>

IV, and is said even to have brought the Emperor to tears. As in
other parts of Europe, fanatical preaching was rife at this time, and in
Turkey we find also Sabatai Sevi, who tried to make himself out to be
the Messiah, and whose followers exist to this day. Vani attacked him
furiously, and tried to convert the Jews to Mahommedanism. He was
very instrumental in putting down the use of wine, and before the
standard of the Turkish army he prayed with fanatical enthusiasm.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 1. General Terms">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 3. The Project Gutenberg Literary">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
